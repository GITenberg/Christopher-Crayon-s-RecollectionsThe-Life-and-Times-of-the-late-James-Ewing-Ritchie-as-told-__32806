3</span>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smcap">East Anglia in 1837</span>.</h2>
<p>In 1837 Lord Melbourne was Prime Minister&mdash;the
handsomest, the most cultivated, the most courteous gentleman
that ever figured in a Royal Court.&nbsp; For his young mistress
he had a loyal love, whilst she, young and inexperienced,
naturally turned to him as her guide, philosopher and
friend.&nbsp; The Whigs were in office, but not in power.&nbsp;
The popular excitement that had carried the Reform Bill had died
away, and the Ministry had rendered itself especially unpopular
by a new Poor-Law Bill, a bold, a praiseworthy, a successful
attempt to deal with the growing demoralisation of the
agricultural population.&nbsp; Lord Melbourne was at that time
the only possible Premier.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no small
talk,&rdquo; said the Iron Duke, &ldquo;and Peel has no
manners,&rdquo; and few men had such grace and chivalry as Lord
Melbourne, then a childless widower in his manhood&rsquo;s
prime.&nbsp; He swore a good deal, as all fine gentlemen did in
the early days of Queen Victoria.&nbsp; One day Mr. Denison,
afterwards Lord Ossington, encountered Lord Melbourne as he was
about to mount his horse, <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and called attention to some required
modification in the new Poor-Law Bill.&nbsp; Lord Melbourne
referred him to his brother George.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been with
him,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but he damned me, and damned
the Bill, and damned the paupers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, damn
it, what more could he do?&rdquo; was the rejoinder.&nbsp; And in
East Anglia there was a good deal of swearing among the
gentry.&nbsp; I can remember an ancient peer who had been brought
up in the Navy, who resided in the Eastern Counties, and who
somehow or other had been prevailed upon to attend as chairman at
a meeting of the local Bible Society.&nbsp; I have forgotten the
greater part of the noble Lord&rsquo;s speech, but I well
remember how his Lordship not a little shocked some of his
hearers by finishing up with the remark&mdash;that the Bible
Society was a damned good Society, and ought to be damned well
supported.&nbsp; Another noble Lord, of Norfolk, had some fair
daughters, who distinguished themselves in the hunting field,
where they had a habit of swearing as terribly as an army in
Flanders.&nbsp; In this respect we have changed for the better;
ladies never swear now.</p>
<p>In politics bribery and corruption and drunkenness everywhere
prevailed.&nbsp; It was impossible to fight an election with
clean hands.&nbsp; In 1837 there was an election at Norwich; the
late Right Hon. W. E. Forster has left us a good account of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Went to the nomination <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>of city
candidates this morning.&nbsp; The nomination was at eight.&nbsp;
Went in with the mob into the lower court.&nbsp; Great rush when
the door was opened.&nbsp; When the Crier demanded attention for
the reading of the Act against bribery and corruption, he burst
out laughing at the end, in which he was followed by the Sheriff,
candidates and almost everybody else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The show of
hands was, as was generally the case, in favour of the
Liberal.&nbsp; But on the next day&mdash;that of the
poll&mdash;the Tories were declared to have the majority.&nbsp;
All round the polling booths the rioting was great, as men were
brought up in batches to vote&mdash;each party struggling to
prevent their being done by the other, and a good deal of
fighting ensued.&nbsp; Mr. Forster writes:&mdash;&ldquo;About
nine I sallied forth to take observations.&nbsp; At the Magdalen
Ward booth I saw some dreadful cases of voting by drunken people,
both Whig and Tory&mdash;one in which the man could hardly speak,
and there were two men roaring Smith and Nurse (the names of the
Whig candidates) in his ears.&nbsp; I went to see all the polling
places in the course of time.&nbsp; About three I saw some
furious bludgeon-fighting in Palace Plain, the police taking
bludgeons from some Tory hired countrymen.&nbsp; The Mayor and
Sheriff were there.&nbsp; One of the police was badly wounded by
a bludgeon.&nbsp; The soldiers were sent for, and then the Mayor,
thinking he could do without them, sent George Everett, the <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Sheriff&rsquo;s son, a boy, and myself to stop
them.&nbsp; We very soon met them in the road leading from the
Plain to the barracks trotting forward with their swords
drawn.&nbsp; We held up our hands and partially stopped them, but
the Mayor altered his mind and they came on.&nbsp; The policemen
had got the better, but the soldiers soon cleared the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The election over&mdash;it is said to have cost
&pound;40,000&mdash;the triumphant Members were borne in chairs
on men&rsquo;s shoulders and carried through the streets&mdash;a
very unpleasant process, as they had to smile and bow to the
crowd of lookers-on in the streets and in the houses along which
they passed.&nbsp; The old dragon Snap from St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall figured in the show.&nbsp; Out-voters were brought from
London and other parts of the country in stage coaches hired for
the purpose.&nbsp; Every one showed his colour, and every one was
primed with beer and ready for a row.&nbsp; A General Election
was a saturnalia of the most blackguard character.&nbsp; In all,
Norfolk returned twelve Members&mdash;four for the county, the
Eastern Division sending two Members, the influential landlords
being Lord Wodehouse, the Earl of Desart and the Marquis of
Cholmondeley, with an electorate of 4,396.&nbsp; In West Norfolk
the electors were not so numerous, and the influence was chiefly
possessed by the Earl of Leicester, Lord Hastings, the Marquis of
Cholmondeley, Lord <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Charles Townshend and the Marquis of
that name.&nbsp; In both divisions Conservatives were
returned.&nbsp; In the Eastern Division of Suffolk, which had its
headquarters at Ipswich, the electorate returned two
Members&mdash;Lord Henniker and Sir Charles Broke Vere.&nbsp; The
leading landlords were the Earl of Stradbroke, the Duke of
Hamilton, the Marquis of Hertford, the Dysart family, and Sir
Thomas Gooch.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had represented the county up to
the time of the Reform Bill; in 1832 Robert Newton Shawe was
elected.&nbsp; West Suffolk, whose chief electoral town was Bury
St. Edmund&rsquo;s, returned Tories, under the influence of the
Marquis of Bristol and other landlords.&nbsp; The boroughs did a
little better; Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s returned one Liberal, Lord
Charles Fitzroy, elected by 289 votes, and Lord Jermyn (C.), who
polled 277 votes.&nbsp; Colchester, however, a very costly seat
to gain, was held by the Conservatives.&nbsp; Chelmsford and
Braintree were the chief polling places of Essex north and south,
and in both divisions Conservatives were returned.&nbsp; Eye
rejoiced in its hereditary representative, Sir Edward Kerrison,
Conservative.&nbsp; It is strange that so small a borough was
spared by the first Reform Bill.&nbsp; In our time it has been
very properly disfranchised.&nbsp; Sudbury, a Suffolk borough, a
little larger, which returned two Conservatives in 1837, was very
properly disfranchised for bribery in 1844.&nbsp; <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Ipswich
was also supposed to be by no means an immaculate borough.&nbsp;
Dodd writes concerning it: &ldquo;Money has long been considered
the best friend in Ipswich, and petitions on the ground of
bribery, &amp;c., have been frequent.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1837 it
returned one Liberal and one Conservative, Milner Gibson, whom
Sir Thomas Gooch, of Benacre Hall, recommended to the electors as
a promising Conservative colt.&nbsp; He lived to become M.P. for
Manchester, to be one of the leaders of the Anti-Corn Law
Movement, the head of the Society for the Repeal of the Taxes on
Knowledge, a society which owed a great deal of its success to
his Parliamentary skill as a tactician, and to be a Member of a
Liberal Administration.&nbsp; There were few finer,
manlier-looking men in the House of Commons than Thomas Milner
Gibson.&nbsp; At any rate, I thought so as I watched him, after
the delivery of a most effective speech in Drury Lane Theatre on
the Corn Laws, step into a little ham and beef shop close by for
a light for his cigar.&nbsp; At that time, let me remind the
reader, waxlights and matches were unknown.&nbsp; The electoral
body in Ipswich was not a large one.&nbsp; At the Reform Act
period it consisted of 1,800.&nbsp; At that time the constituency
had been increased by adding to the freemen, of whom little more
than three hundred remained, the ten-pound householders within
the old borough, which <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>included twelve parishes.&nbsp; It is
curious to note that, in 1839, Mr. Milner Gibson, who had
resigned his seat on his becoming a Liberal, was rejected, the
numbers being&mdash;Sir Thomas Cochrane (Conservative), 621;
Milner Gibson, 615.&nbsp; Ipswich seems always to have been
undergoing the excitement of a General Election&mdash;and, it is
to be feared, enjoying the profits of an election contest, as no
sooner was an election over than it was declared void&mdash;and a
new writ was issued.&nbsp; In 1837 Thetford, no longer a
Parliamentary borough, returned two M.P.&rsquo;s, one
Conservative and one Liberal.&nbsp; A little more has yet to be
written relative to smaller East Anglian boroughs.&nbsp; Lynn,
under the influence of the Duke of Portland, in 1837 returned two
distinguished men to Parliament: Lord George Bentinck, then a
great racing man, but who was better known as the leader of the
Protectionist party, and Sir Stratford Canning, the great Eltchi,
who was to reign imperiously in the East, and at whose frown
Turkish Sultans trembled.&nbsp; Maldon returned two
Conservatives.&nbsp; It has long very properly ceased to exercise
that privilege.&nbsp; Great Yarmouth, which has now an electorate
of 7,876, at the General Election in 1837 returned two Liberals,
but the highest Liberal vote was 790, and the highest Tory vote
699.&nbsp; Money was the best friend at Yarmouth, as in most
boroughs.&nbsp; In accounting for the loss of his <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>seat
at Weymouth in 1837, one of our greatest East Anglians, Sir
Thomas Fowell Buxton, writes:&mdash;&ldquo;My supporters told me
that it would be necessary to open public-houses, and to lend
money&mdash;a gentle name for bribery&mdash;to the extent of
&pound;1,000.&nbsp; I, of course, declined.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, as
a boy, I must own I enjoyed the fun, the excitement, the fighting
of the old elections, much more than the elections of later
times.&nbsp; If now and then a skull was cracked, what mattered,
while the Constitution was saved!</p>
<p>In the religious world the change in East Anglia has been
immense; the Church was weak, now it has become strong.&nbsp; In
most of the villages were good Dissenting congregations, but the
landlords set their faces against the
Dissenters&mdash;&ldquo;pograms&rdquo; was what they were
contemptuously called&mdash;and the landlord&rsquo;s lady had no
mercy on them.&nbsp; The good things in the hall were only
reserved for those who attended the parish church.&nbsp; At that
time we had two bishops; both resided in Norwich.&nbsp; One was
the Bishop of the Diocese; the other was the Rev. John Alexander,
who preached in Princes Street Chapel, where the Rev. Dr. Barrett
has succeeded him&mdash;a man universally beloved and universally
popular, as he deserved to be.&nbsp; As for the clergy of that
day, I fear many of them led scandalous lives: there was hardly
one when I was a boy, within reach of the parish where I was
born, whom decent women, with any <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>serious
thoughts at all, could go to hear, and consequently they, with
their families, went to the nearest Independent Chapel, where it
was a sight to see the farmers&rsquo; gigs on the green in the
chapel yard.&nbsp; They go to the Church now, as the clergyman is
quite as devoted to his high calling and quite as earnest in his
vocation as his Independent brother.&nbsp; Bishop Bathurst had
let things slide too much, as was to be expected of a man whose
great complaint in his old age was that they had sent him a dean
who could not play whist.&nbsp; Bishop Stanley&rsquo;s wife
complained to Miss Caroline Fox how trying was her
husband&rsquo;s position at Norwich, as his predecessor was an
amiable, indolent old man, who let things take their course, and
a very bad course they took.&nbsp; It was in his Diocese&mdash;at
Hadleigh&mdash;the Oxford movement commenced, when in 1833 the
Vicar, the Rev. James Rose, assembled at the parsonage&mdash;not
the present handsome building, which is evidently of later
date&mdash;the men who were to become famous as Tractarians, who
had met there to consider how to save the Church.&nbsp; It was
then in danger, as Lord Grey had recommended the Bishops to put
their house in order.&nbsp; Ten Irish Bishoprics had been
suppressed; a mob at Bristol had burnt the Bishop&rsquo;s palace;
and in Norwich the cry had been raised for &ldquo;more pigs and
less parsons.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the leaders of the Evangelical
party resided at Kirkley.&nbsp; The Rev. Francis <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Cuningham&mdash;afterwards Rector of Lowestoft&mdash;had
established infant schools, which were then a novelty in East
Anglia.&nbsp; His wife was one of the Gurneys, of Earlham, a
great power in Norfolk at that time.&nbsp; Joseph John was well
known in London philanthropic circles and all over the land,
especially in connection with the anti-Slavery and Bible
Societies; and at his house men of all religious parties were
welcome.&nbsp; At that time, Clarkson, the great anti-Slavery
advocate, had come to Playford Hall, near Woodbridge, there to
spend in quiet the remainder of his days.&nbsp; In all East
Anglian leading towns Nonconformity was very respectable, and its
leading men were men of influence and usefulness in their
respective localities.&nbsp; It was even so at Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s in Mr. Dewhurst&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; His son, whom
I met with in South Australia holding a position in the
Educational Department, told me how Rowland Hill came to the town
to preach for his father.&nbsp; As there were no railways the
great preacher came in his own carriage, and naturally was very
anxious as to the welfare of his horses.&nbsp; Mr. Dewhurst told
him that he need have no anxiety on that score, as he had a
horsedealer a member of his church, who would look after
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Rowland Hill, in amazement,
&ldquo;a horsedealer a member of a Christian Church; whoever
heard of such a thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; From which I gather that
Rowland <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Hill knew more of London horsedealers
than East Anglian ones.&nbsp; I can well remember that many of
the old Nonconformist pulpits were filled by men such as Ray of
Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s, Creak of Yarmouth, Elvin of Bury
(Baptist), Notcutt of Ipswich, and Sloper of Beccles, a friend of
Mrs. Siddons.&nbsp; A great power in Beccles and its
neighbourhood was the Rev. George Wright, the father of the
celebrated scholar, Dr. Aldis Wright, of Cambridge, who still
lives to adorn and enlighten the present age.&nbsp; Some of the
old Nonconformist chapels were grotesque specimens of rustic
architecture.&nbsp; This was especially so at Halesworth, which
had a meeting-house&mdash;as it was then called&mdash;with
gigantic pillars under the galleries.&nbsp; It was there the Rev.
John Dennant preached&mdash;the grandfather of the popular Sir
John Robinson, of <i>The Daily News</i>, a dear old man much
given to writing poetry, of which, alas! posterity takes no
heed.&nbsp; The charm of the old Nonconformist places was the
great square pews, lined with green baize, where on a hot Sunday
afternoon many a hearer was rewarded with&mdash;I can speak from
experience&mdash;a delightful snooze.&nbsp; The great exception
was at Norwich, where there was a fine modern Baptist Chapel,
known as &ldquo;the fashionable watering-place,&rdquo; where, in
1837, the late William Brock had just commenced what proved to be
a highly-successful pastoral career.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>As to the theology of the cottagers in East Anglia at
that time, I can offer no better illustration of it than that
given by Miss Caroline Fox of a cottage talk she had somewhere
near Norwich.&nbsp; She writes, &ldquo;A young woman told us that
her father was nearly converted, and that a little more teaching
would complete the business,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;He quite
believes that he is lost, which, of course, is a great
consolation to the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Literature flourished in East Anglia in 1837.&nbsp; Bulwer
Lytton, an East Anglian by birth and breeding, had just published
&ldquo;Paul Clifford,&rdquo; and was about to commence a new and
better style of novel.&nbsp; Norwich had long been celebrated for
its Literary Society, and one of the most remarkable of the
literary men of the age was George Borrow, author of the
&ldquo;Bible in Spain,&rdquo; the materials for which he was then
collecting, and who spent much of his life in East Anglia, where
he was born.&nbsp; He was five years in Spain during the
disturbed early years of Isabella II., and he travelled in every
part of Castile and Leon, as well as the southern part of the
Peninsula and Northern Portugal.&nbsp; Again and again his
adventurous habits brought him into danger among brigands and
Carlists, as well as Roman Catholic priests, and he experienced a
brief imprisonment in Madrid.&nbsp; At Norwich also was then
living Mrs. Opie&mdash;as a Quakeress&mdash;after having spent
the greater part <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of her life in London gaiety.&nbsp; A
lady who met her in Brussels says she spoke with much enthusiasm
of the eminent artists, who, in her part of the
world&mdash;videlicet, the Eastern Counties&mdash;had become men
of mark.&nbsp; Of her husband, who had been dead many years, she
said playfully that if neither Suffolk nor Norfolk could boast of
the honour of being his birthplace, he had done his best to
remedy the evil by marrying a Norwich woman.&nbsp; At Reydon
Hall, rather a tumble-down old place, as I recollect it, lived
the Stricklands, and of the six daughters of the house five were
literary women more or less successful.&nbsp; Of these the best
known was Agnes, author of &ldquo;The Lives of the Queens of
England,&rdquo; which owed much of its success to being published
just after the Princess Victoria had become Queen of England.</p>
<p>It was amusing to hear her talk, in her somewhat affected and
stilted style, of politics.&nbsp; She was a Jacobin, and hated
all Dissenters, whom she sneered at as Roundheads.&nbsp; With
modern ideas she and her sisters had no sympathy whatever.&nbsp;
There never was such an antediluvian family.&nbsp; All of them
were very long-lived, and must have bitterly bewailed the
progress of Democracy and Dissent.&nbsp; I question whether the
&ldquo;Lives of the Queens of England&rdquo; has many readers
now.&nbsp; Near Woodbridge, as rector of Benhall, lived the Rev.
J. Mitford, an <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>active literary man, the editor of
<i>The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, and of some of the
standard works known as Pickering&rsquo;s Classics.&nbsp; As a
clergyman he was a failure.&nbsp; It was urged in his defence, by
his friends, that his profession had been chosen for him by
others, and that when it was too late for him to escape from the
bonds which held him in thrall he made the discovery that the
life that lay before him was utterly uncongenial to his tastes
and habits.&nbsp; His life, when in Suffolk, writes Mrs. Houston,
author of &ldquo;A Woman&rsquo;s Memories of World-known
Men,&rdquo; must have been a very solitary one.&nbsp; For causes
which I have never heard explained, his wife had long left him,
and his only son was not on speaking terms with the Rector of
Benhall.&nbsp; In his small lodgings on the second floor in
Sloane Street, he was doubtless a far happier man than, in spite
of his well-loved garden and extensive library at Benhall
Rectory, he ever, in his country home, professed to be.&nbsp; But
perhaps the most notable East Anglian author at the time was
Isaac Taylor, of Ongar, whose books&mdash;&ldquo;The Natural
History of Enthusiasm&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Physical Theory of
Another Life&rdquo;&mdash;were most popular, and one of which, at
any rate, had been noticed in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>.&nbsp;
In a private letter to the editor, Sir James Stephen describes
Taylor &ldquo;as a very considerable man, with but small
inventive but very great diffusive <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>powers,
possessing a considerable mastery of language, but very apt to be
over-mastered by it&mdash;too fine a writer to write very well;
too fastidious a censor to judge men and things equitably; too
much afraid of falling into cant and vulgarity to rise to freedom
and ease; an over-polished Dissenter, a little ashamed of his
origin among that body; but, with all this, a man of vigorous and
catholic understanding, of eminent purity of mind, happy in
himself and in all manner of innocent pleasure, and strenuously
devoted to the grand but impracticable task of grafting on the
intellectual democracy of our own times the literary aristocracy
of the days that are passed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quite a different man
was dear old Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet, of Woodbridge, with
whom I dined once, who was more fat than bard beseems, and who
seemed to me to enjoy a good dinner, a glass of port&mdash;people
could drink port in those days&mdash;and a pinch of snuff, quite
as much as any literary talk.&nbsp; Poor Bernard never set the
Thames on fire&mdash;he would have been shocked at the thought of
doing anything so wicked; but he was a good man, and quite
competent to shine in &ldquo;Fulcher&rsquo;s Pocket Book,&rdquo;
a work published yearly by Fulcher, of Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s,
and much better than any of its contemporaries.</p>
<p>In connection with this subject let me quote from Bernard
Barton a sketch of a Suffolk yeoman, <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>very rare in
these times: &ldquo;He was a hearty old yeoman of about
eighty-six, and occupied the farm in which he lived and died,
about fifty-five years.&nbsp; Sociable, hospitable, friendly; a
liberal master to his labourers, a kind neighbour, and a right
merry companion within the limits of becoming mirth; in politics
a staunch Whig; in his theological creed as sturdy a Dissenter;
yet with no more party spirit in him than a child.&nbsp; He and I
belonged to the same book club for about forty years.&nbsp; He
entered it about fifteen years before I came into these parts,
and was really a pillar in our literary temple, not that he
greatly cared about books or was deeply read in them, but he
loved to meet his neighbours and get them round him on any
occasion or no occasion at all.&nbsp; As a fine specimen of the
true English yeoman I have met few to equal, hardly any to
surpass him, and he looked the character as well as he acted it,
till within a very few years, when the strong man was bowed with
infirmity.&nbsp; About twenty-six years ago, in his dress costume
of a blue coat and yellow buckskins, a finer sample of John
Bullism you would rarely see.&nbsp; It was the whole study of his
long life to make the few who revolved about him in his little
orbit as happy as he always seemed to be himself; yet I was
gravely queried with, when I happened to say that his children
had asked me to write a few lines to his memory, whether <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>I could do so in keeping with the general tenor of my
poetry.&nbsp; The speaker doubted if he was a decidedly pious
character.&nbsp; He had at times been known in his altitudes to
vociferate at the top of his voice a song, the chorus of which
was not certainly teetotalish:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sing, old Rose, and burn the bellows,<br />
Drink and drive dull care away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can anything be finer than this picture of a Suffolk
yeoman?&nbsp; Is it not a pity that such men are no more to be
seen?&nbsp; High farming was unknown when the old Suffolk yeoman
lived.&nbsp; I claim for Bernard Barton that this sketch of the
Suffolk yeoman is the best thing he ever wrote.&nbsp; Bernard
Barton&rsquo;s daughter married the great Oriental scholar,
Edward Fitzgerald, the friend of Carlyle and correspondent of
Fanny Kemble, who lived in the neighbourhood of Woodbridge, and
whose fame now he is no more is far greater than when he
lived.&nbsp; Little could he have anticipated that in after years
literary men would assemble in the quiet churchyard of Boulge to
erect his monument over his grave, or to found a society to
perpetuate his name.</p>
<p>As I lean back for another glance, my eyes, as Wordsworth
writes, are filled with childish tears&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My heart is idly stirred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see the dear old village where I was born, <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>almost
encroaching on Sir Thomas Gooch&rsquo;s park, at Benacre Hall; I
see the old baronet, a fine old bigoted Tory, who looked the
picture of health and happiness, as he ambled past on his
chestnut cob, wearing a blue coat, a white hat and trousers, in
summer; his only regret being that things were not as they
were&mdash;his only consolation the fact that, wisely, the
Eternal Providence that overrules all human affairs had provided
snug rectories for his kith and kin, however unworthy of the
sacred calling; and had hung up the sun, moon and stars so high
in the heavens that no reforming ass</p>
<blockquote><p>Could e&rsquo;er presume to pluck them down, and
light the world with gas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then comes the village medico, healthy and shrewd and kindly,
with a firm belief&mdash;alas! that day is gone now&mdash;in
black draught and blue pill.&nbsp; I see his six sunny daughters
racing down the village street, guarded by a dragon of a
governess, and I get out of their way, for I am a rustic, and
have all the rustic&rsquo;s fear of what the East Anglian peasant
was used to term &ldquo;morthers&rdquo;; and then comes the
squire of the next parish, in as shabby a trap as you ever set
eyes on, and the fat farmer, who hails me for a walk, and going
to the end of a field, joyously, or as joyously as his sluggish
nature will permit, exclaims, &ldquo;There, Master James, <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>now you can see three farms.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend was
a utilitarian, and could only see the beautiful in the
useful.&nbsp; Then I call up the memory of the village grocer, a
stern, unbending Radical, who delights me with the loan of
Cruikshank&rsquo;s illustrations to the &ldquo;House that Jack
Built,&rdquo; mysteriously wrapped in brown paper and stowed away
between the sugar and treacle.&nbsp; He does not talk much, but
he thinks the more.&nbsp; And now it strikes me that conversation
was not much cultivated in the villages of East Anglia in 1837,
and yet there were splendid exceptions&mdash;on such evenings as
when the members of the Book Club met in our parlour, where the
best tea things were laid, and where a kindly mother in black
silk and white shawl and quakerish cap made tea; where an
honoured father, who now sleeps far away from the scene of his
life-long labours, indulged in a genial humour, which set at ease
the shyest of his guests; and again, what a splendid talk there
was when the brethren in black from Beccles, from Yarmouth, from
Halesworth, gathered for fraternal purposes, perhaps once a
quarter, to smoke long pipes, to discuss metaphysics and
politics, and to puzzle their heads over divines and systems that
have long ceased to perplex the world.&nbsp; Few and simple were
East Anglian annals then.&nbsp; It was seldom the London coach,
the Yarmouth Mail and Telegraph brought a cockney down to
astonish <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>us with his pert ways and peculiar
talk.&nbsp; Life was slow, but it was kindly, nevertheless.&nbsp;
There was no fear of bacteria, nor of poison in the pot, nor of
the ills of bad drainage.&nbsp; We were poor, but honest.&nbsp;
Are we better now?</p>
<p>In 1837 the railways which unite the country under the title
of the Great Eastern had not come into existence.</p>
<p>All is changed in East Anglia except the boys.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have seen a good many changes in your time,&rdquo;
said the young curate to the old village clerk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;everything is changed
except the boys, and they&rsquo;re allus the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
fear the boys are as troublesome as ever&mdash;perhaps a little
more so now, when you cannot touch them with a stick, which any
one might do years ago.&nbsp; When we caught a boy up to mischief
a stick did a deal of good in the good old times that are gone
never to return.</p>
<p>In connection with literature one naturally turns to the
Bungay Printing Press, at the head of which was John Childs, who
assembled round his hospitable board at Bungay many celebrated
people, and to whom at a later period Daniel O&rsquo;Connell paid
a visit.&nbsp; It was Childs who gave to the poor student cheap
editions of standard works such as Burke and Gibbon and
Bacon.&nbsp; It was he who went to Ipswich Gaol rather than pay
Church Rates.&nbsp; It was he who was one of the first to attack
the Bible printing monopoly, and thus to flood the land with
cheap <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Bibles and Testaments.&nbsp; A
self-made man, almost Napoleonic in appearance, with a habit of
blurting out sharp cynicisms and original epigrams, rather than
conversing.&nbsp; He was a great phrenologist, and I well
remember how I, a raw lad, rather trembled in his presence as I
saw his dark, keen eyes directed towards that part of my person
where the brains are supposed to be.&nbsp; I imagine the result
was favourable, as at a later time I spent many a pleasant hour
in his dining-room, gathering wisdom from his after-dinner talk,
and inspiration from his port&mdash;as good as that immortalised
by Tennyson.&nbsp; Mr. Childs had a numerous and handsome family,
most of whom died after arriving at manhood.&nbsp; His daughter,
who to great personal charms added much of her father&rsquo;s
intellect, did not live long after her marriage, leaving one son,
a leading partner in the great City firm of solicitors, Ashurst,
Morris, and Crisp.&nbsp; After John Childs, of Bungay, I may
mention another East Anglian&mdash;D. Whittle Harvey, who was a
power in his party and among the London cabbies&mdash;to whom the
London cabby owes his badge V.R.&mdash;which, as one of them
sagely remarked, was supposed to signify &ldquo;Whittle
&rsquo;Arvey,&rdquo; an etymology at any rate not worse than that
of the savant who in his wisdom derived gherkin from Jeremiah
King.&nbsp; In 1837 Mr. Johnson Fox, born at Uggeshall, near
Wangford&mdash;better <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>known afterwards as the Norwich
&ldquo;Weaver Boy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Publicola&rdquo; of <i>The
Weekly Dispatch</i>&mdash;the great orator of the Anti-Corn Law
League, was preaching in the Unitarian Chapel, South Place,
Finsbury, and a leading man in London literary society.&nbsp; One
of the best-known men in East Anglia was Allan Ransome, of
Ipswich, the young Quaker, who was on very friendly terms with
the Strickland family, who cultivated literature and business
with equal zest.&nbsp; Nor, in this category, should I pass over
the name of George Bird, of Yoxford, a local chemist, who found
time to write of Dunwich Castle and such-like East Anglian
themes&mdash;I fancy now read by none.&nbsp; A Suffolk man who
was making his mark in London at that time was Crabbe Robinson,
the pioneer of the special correspondent of our later day.&nbsp;
And just when Queen Victoria began to reign, Thomas Woolner, the
poet-sculptor, was leaving his native town of Hadleigh to begin
life as the pupil of Boehm, sculptor in ordinary to the
Queen.&nbsp; And yet East Anglia was by no means distinguished,
or held to be of much account in the gay circles of wit and
fashion in town.&nbsp; The gentry were but little better than
those drawn to the life in the novels of Fielding and
Smollett.&nbsp; I am inclined to think there was very little
reading outside Dissenting circles&mdash;where the book club was
a standing institution, and <i>The Edinburgh Review</i> <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>was
looked up to as an oracle, as indeed it was, sixty years
ago.&nbsp; There was little encouragement of manly sports and
pastimes&mdash;indeed, very little for any one in the way of
amusement but at the public-house.&nbsp; Not that any one was
ever drunk, in the liberal opinion of the landlord of the
public-house, only &ldquo;a little fresh,&rdquo; and the village
policeman was unknown.&nbsp; It is true there might be a
constable, but he was a very mythical person indeed.&nbsp;
Everybody drank, and as a rule the poorer people were the more
they drank.</p>
<p>One of the early temperance lecturers in the district, Mr.
Thomas Whittaker, who was mobbed, especially at Framlingham,
tells us Essex and Suffolk are clayey soils, in some districts
very heavy and not easily broken up, and the people in many cases
correspond.&nbsp; It was due to Mr. Marriage, of Chelmsford, a
maltster, who turned his malting house into a temperance hall,
and Mr. D. Alexander, of Ipswich, that the temperance reformers
made way; and at that time James Larner, of Framlingham, aided by
young Mr. Thompson (now the great London surgeon, Sir Henry
Thompson), was quite a power.&nbsp; But the difficulties were
great in the way of finding places for meetings, or of getting to
them in muddy lanes, or of getting the anti-teetotalers to behave
decently, or of the lecturers finding accommodation for the
night.&nbsp; Education would <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>have been
left almost alone, had not the Liberals started the British and
Foreign schools, which roused the Church party to action.&nbsp;
The one village schoolmaster with whom I came into contact
was&mdash;as were most of his class&mdash;one who had seen better
days, who wore top boots, and whose chief instrument in teaching
the young idea how to shoot was a ruler, of which he seemed to me
to take rather an unfair advantage.&nbsp; The people were
ignorant, and, like Lord Melbourne, did not see much good in
making a fuss about education.&nbsp; They could rarely read or
write, and if they could there was nothing for them to
read&mdash;no cheap books nor cheap magazines and
newspapers.&nbsp; Now we have run to the other extreme, and it is
to be hoped we are all the better.&nbsp; Cottages were mostly in
an unsanitary state, but the labourer, in his white smock, looked
well on a Sunday at the village church or chapel, and the
children at the Sunday-school were clean, if a little restless
under the long, dry sermon which they were compelled to hear, the
caretaker being generally provided with a long stick to admonish
the thoughtless, to wake up the sleepy, to prevent too much
indulgence in apples during sermon time, or too liberal a display
of the miscellaneous treasures concealed in a boy&rsquo;s
pocket.&nbsp; Perhaps the most influential person in the village
was the gamekeeper, who was supposed to be armed, and to have the
power of <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>committing all boys in undue
eagerness to go bird-nesting to the nearest gaol.&nbsp; He was to
me, I own, a terror by night and by day, as he was constantly in
my way&mdash;when tempted to break into the neighbouring park in
search of flowers or eggs.&nbsp; The farmer then, as now, was
ruined, but he was a picture of health and comfort as he drove to
the nearest market town, where after business he would spend the
evening smoking and drinking, with his broad beaver on his head,
his fat carcase ornamented with a blue coat with brass buttons,
and his knee breeches of yellow kerseymere.&nbsp; It was little
he read to wake up his sluggish intellect, save the county
newspaper, which it was the habit for people to take between them
to lessen the expense.&nbsp; A newspaper was sevenpence, of which
fourpence went to pay for the stamp.&nbsp; Everything was
dear&mdash;the postage of a letter was 10d. or 1s.&nbsp; The
franking of letters by Members of Parliament existed at that
time; they could receive an unlimited number of letters free of
postage, of any weight, even a pianoforte, a saddle, a haunch of
venison, and they might send out fourteen a day.&nbsp; Loaf sugar
was too dear to be in daily use; tea and coffee were heavily
taxed; soap was too dear to use; and wearing apparel and boots
and shoes very expensive; even if you went for a drive there was
the turnpike gate, and a heavy toll to pay.&nbsp; As to
geography, it was a science utterly <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>unknown.&nbsp; Poor people when they talked of the
Midland Counties called them the Shires, and I have heard serious
disputes as to whether you got to America by sea or land.&nbsp;
The finest men in East Anglia were the sailors at the various
sea-ports along the coast, well-shaped, fair-haired, with grand
limbs and blue eyes, evidently of Saxon or Norse descent, and
their daughters were as handsome as any girls I ever saw.&nbsp;
The peasant had his little bit of garden, where he could keep a
pig and grow a few vegetables and flowers, but much of the
furniture was of the poorest description, much inferior to what
it is now, and his lot was not a happy one.&nbsp; As to
locomotion, it did not exist.&nbsp; To go a few miles from home
was quite an event; on the main roads ran coaches, with two, or
three, or four horses, but the general mode of conveyance was the
carrier&rsquo;s cart, sometimes drawn by one horse and sometimes
by two.&nbsp; Some of the happiest days of my life were spent in
the carrier&rsquo;s cart, where the travellers were seated on the
luggage, their feet well protected by straw, where we were all
hail fellows well met, and each enjoyed his little joke,
especially when the rural intellect was stimulated by beer and
baccy.&nbsp; The old village inn where we stopped to water the
horses and refresh the inner man seemed to me all the more
respectable when compared with the pestiferous beershops that had
then begun to infest the land, to <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>increase the
crime, the misery, the pauperism of a district which already had
quite enough of them before.</p>
<p>But to return to locomotion.&nbsp; A post-chaise was generally
resorted to when the gentry travelled.&nbsp; It was painted
yellow and black, and on one of the two horses by which it was
drawn was seated an ancient, withered old man, generally known as
the post-boy, whose age might be anywhere between forty and
eighty, dressed in a jockey costume, in white hat and top boots;
altogether, a bent, grotesque figure whom Tennyson must have had
in his eye when he wrote&mdash;for the post-boy was often as not
an ostler&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wrinkled ostler, grim and thin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is custom come your way;<br />
Take my brute and lead him in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuff his ribs with mouldy hay.</p>

<span class="smcap">A life&rsquo;s memories</span>.</h2>
<p>Long, long before John Forster wrote to recommend everyone to
write memoirs of himself it had become the fashion to do
so.&nbsp; &ldquo;That celebrated orator,&rdquo; writes Dr. Edmund
Calamy, one of the most learned of our Nonconformist divines,
&ldquo;Caius Cornelius Tacitus, in the beginning of his account
of the life of his father-in-law, Julius Agricola (who was the
General of Domitian, the Emperor, here in Britain, and the first
who made the Roman part of Britain a Pr&aelig;sidial province),
excuses this practice from carrying in it anything of
arrogance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This excellent example was followed by
Julius C&aelig;sar, Marcus Antoninus, many emperors who kept
diaries, Flavius Josephus, St. Gregory of Nazianzen, St.
Augustine, to say nothing of Abraham Schultetus, the celebrated
professor at Heidelberg; of the learned Fuetius; of Basompierre,
the celebrated marshal of France; of the ever-amusing and
garrulous Montaigne; or of our own Richard Baxter, or of Edmund
Calamy himself.&nbsp; The fact is, it has ever been the <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>fashion with men who have handled the pen freely to
write more or less about themselves and the times in which they
lived, and there is no pleasanter reading than such biographical
recollections; and really it matters little whether on the
world&rsquo;s stage the actor acted high tragedy or low comedy so
that he writes truthfully as far as he can about himself and his
times.&nbsp; If old Montaigne is to be believed there is nothing
like writing about oneself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;not only speak of myself, but of myself
alone,&rdquo; and never man handled better the very satisfactory
theme.&nbsp; If I follow in the steps of my betters I can do no
harm, and I may do good if I can show how the England of to-day
is changed for the better since I first began to observe that
working men and women are better off, that our middle and upper
classes have clearer views of duty and responsibility, that we
are the better for the political and social and religious reforms
that have been achieved of late, that, in fact,</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . through the ages one increasing purpose
runs,<br />
And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the
suns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one great complaint I have to make with respect to my
father and mother, to whom I owe so much, and whose memory I
shall ever revere, was that they brought me into the world forty
or fifty years too soon.&nbsp; In 1820, when I first saw the
light of day, England was <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>in a very
poor way.&nbsp; It was what the late Earl of Derby used to call
the pre-scientific era.&nbsp; Gross darkness covered the
land.&nbsp; The excitement of war was over, and the lavish outlay
it occasioned being stopped, life was stagnant, farmers and
manufacturers alike were at low-water mark, and the social and
religious and political reforms required by the times were as yet
undreamed of.&nbsp; However, one good thing my parents did for
me.&nbsp; They lived in a country village in the extreme east of
Suffolk, not far from the sea, where I could lead a natural life,
where I could grow healthy, if not wise, and be familiar with all
the impulses which spring up in the heart under the influences of
rural life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boyhood in the country,&rdquo; writes
William Howitt in his autobiography&mdash;&ldquo;Paradise of
opening existence!&nbsp; Up to the age of ten this life was all
my own.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus it was with me.&nbsp; Existence was
a pleasure, and the weather, I believe, was better then than it
is now.&nbsp; We had summer in summer time.&nbsp; We had fine
weather when harvest commenced, and to spend a day at one of the
neighbouring farmers riding the fore horse was a delight which
thrilled me with joy; and winter, with its sliding and
snowballing, with its clear skies and its glittering snows,
rendering the landscape lovelier than ever, made me forget the
inevitable chilblains, which was the price we had to pay for all
its glories and its charms.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Our little village was situated on the high road between
London and Great Yarmouth, along which rolled twice a day the
London and Yarmouth Royal Mail, drawn by four horses, and driven
by a fat man in red, whom we raw village lads regarded as a very
superior person indeed.&nbsp; Behind sat the guard, also in red,
with a horn, which he blew lustily when occasion required.&nbsp;
There was a time, but that was much later, when a day coach was
put on, and, as it changed horses at our village inn, one of our
chief delights was to see the tired, heated, smoking horses taken
out, and their places filled by a new set, much given to kicking
and plunging at starting, to the immense delight of the juvenile
spectators.&nbsp; Even the passengers I regarded with awe.&nbsp;
In fourteen hours would they not be in London where the King
lived&mdash;where were the Houses of Parliament, the Bank and the
Tower and the soldiers?&nbsp; What would I not have given to be
on that roof urging on, under the midnight stars, my wild
career!&nbsp; Now and then a passenger would be dropped in our
little village.&nbsp; What a nine days&rsquo; wonder he was,
especially if he were a Cockney and talked in the language of
Cockaigne&mdash;if he had heard the Iron Duke, or seen royalty
from afar.&nbsp; Nonconformity flourished in the village in spite
of the fact that the neighbouring baronet, at the gates of whose
park the village may be said to have <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>commenced,
was Sir Thomas Gooch&mdash;(Guche was the way the villagers
pronounced his dread name)&mdash;for was he not a county
magistrate, who could consign people to Beccles Gaol, some eight
miles off, and one of the M.P.&rsquo;s for the county, and did
not he and his lady sternly set their faces against
Dissent?&nbsp; If now and then there were coals and blankets to
be distributed&mdash;and very little was done in that way,
charity had not become fashionable then&mdash;you may be sure
that no Dissenter, however needy and deserving, came in for a
share.</p>
<p>The churches round were mostly filled by the baronet&rsquo;s
relatives, who came into possession of the family livings as a
matter of course, and took little thought for the souls of their
parishioners.&nbsp; In fact, very few people did go to
church.&nbsp; In our chapel, of which my father was the minister
for nearly forty years, we had a good congregation, especially of
an afternoon, when the farmers with their families, in carts or
gigs, put in an appearance.&nbsp; One of the ejected had been the
founder of Nonconformity in our village, and its traditions were
all of the most honourable character.&nbsp; A wealthy family had
lived in the hall, which Sir Thomas Gooch had bought and pulled
down, one of whom had been M.P. for the county in
Cromwell&rsquo;s time, and had left a small
endowment&mdash;besides, there was a house for the
minister&mdash;to perpetuate the cause, and it was <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>something amidst the B&oelig;otian darkness all round to
have a man of superior intellect, of a fair amount of learning,
of unspotted life, of devoted piety, such as the old
Nonconformist ministers were, ever seeking to lead the people
upward and onward; while the neighbouring gentry and all the
parsons round, I am sorry to say, set the people a very bad
example.&nbsp; In our time we have changed all that, and the
Church clergy are as zealous to do good as the clergy of any
other denomination.&nbsp; But that things have altered so much
for the better, I hold is mainly due to the great progress made
all over the land by Dissent, which woke up the Church from the
state of sloth and luxury and lethargy which had jeopardised its
very existence.&nbsp; Really, at the time of which I write and in
the particular locality to which I refer, decent godly people
were obliged to forsake the Parish Church, and to seek in the
neighbouring conventicle the aids requisite to a religious
life.&nbsp; At the same time, there was little collision between
Church and Dissent.&nbsp; The latter had its own sphere,
supporting, in addition to its local work, the Bible Society, the
Tract Society, the London Missionary Society, and the
Anti-Slavery Society.&nbsp; It had also its Sunday-school, very
much inferior to what they are now; and, if possible, secured a
day school on the British and Foreign plan.&nbsp; Dissenters paid
Church rates, which the wealthy Churchmen <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>were not
ashamed to collect.&nbsp; They gave the parson his tithes without
a murmur, and politically they were all on the side of the Whigs,
to whom they were indebted for the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts&mdash;barbarous laws&mdash;which had ostracised
intelligent and conscientious Dissenters from all parochial and
municipal and Parliamentary life.&nbsp; When I was a boy no one
could be a parish constable without going through the hideous
farce of taking the Sacrament at his Parish Church.&nbsp; It was
the Dissenters who created the public opinion which enabled Sir
Robert Peel and the Iron Duke to grant Roman Catholic
emancipation.&nbsp; It was they who carried reform and abolished
rotten boroughs, and gave Manchester and Sheffield and Birmingham
the representatives which the Tories, and especially the parsons,
would have denied them.&nbsp; To be a reformer was held by the
clergy and gentry to be a rogue and rascal of the first
rank.&nbsp; I cannot call to mind any public action taken in
support of the suffering and the poor to which the clergy and the
gentry in our village, or in any of the villages round, lent any
support whatever.&nbsp; As regards the great Anti-Slavery
agitation, for instance, the only meeting on the subject was held
in our chapel, where a Captain Pilkington came down from London
to lecture, and touched all our hearts as he showed the lash and
the chains, and the other instruments <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>of torture
which that cruel system sanctioned and required, and you may be
quite sure that when next day I, with boyish pride, pardonable
under the circumstances, was sent round to get signatures for a
petition to Parliament on the subject, it was not long before I
got my paper filled.&nbsp; Naturally the Dissenters were active
in the work, for had not one of their number&mdash;poor Smith,
missionary at Demerara&mdash;been foully murdered by Demerara
magistrates and planters because he took the part of the black
slave against his white owner and tyrant?&nbsp; Yet I was
disgusted, after remembering the effect produced in our Suffolk
village by the captain&rsquo;s eloquence, to read thirty years
after in Sir George Stephens&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anti-Slavery
Recollections,&rdquo; that &ldquo;Pilkington was a pleasing
lecturer, and won over many by his amiable manners, but that he
wanted power, and resigned the duty in about six
months.&rdquo;&nbsp; In our simple village it was enough for us
that a lecturer or speaker came from London; or as the country
people called it Lunnen.&nbsp; That was a sufficient guarantee
for us of his talent, his respectability, and his power.&nbsp;
Since then the scales have fallen even from the eyes of the
rustic, and he no longer sees men as trees walking.&nbsp;
Railways have rendered the journey to London perilously
easy.&nbsp; Hodge, in the vain hope to better himself, has left
his village home, its clear skies, its bracing <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>air, its
healthy toil, its simple hours, and gone to live in the crowded
slums.&nbsp; It may be that he earns better wages, but you may
buy gold too dear.&nbsp; A healthy rustic is far happier in his
village.&nbsp; It is there he should strive to live, rather than
in the town; and a time may come when English legislators will
have wisdom enough to do something to plant the people on the
land, rather than compel them to come to town, to be poisoned by
its bad air, its dangerous companionship, and its evil ways.</p>
<p>As regards intelligence, we were in a poor way.&nbsp; On
Saturdays <i>The Suffolk Chronicle</i> appeared, much to the
delight of the Radicals, while the Tories were cheered by <i>The
Ipswich Journal</i>.&nbsp; At a later time <i>The Patriot</i>
came to our house, and we got an idea of what was going on in the
religious and Dissenting world.&nbsp; Foster&rsquo;s Essays were
to be seen on many shelves, and later on the literary and
religious speculations of Isaac Taylor, of Ongar, and
Dick&rsquo;s writings had also a wonderful sale.&nbsp; I fancy no
one cares much now for any of the writers I have named.&nbsp;
Such is fame!</p>
<p>As a boy it seemed to me I had too much of the
Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism and Virgil, to whose poetic beauties I
was somewhat blind.&nbsp; I resolved to run away, as I fancied
there was something better and brighter than village life.&nbsp;
Religion was not attractive <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>to me.&nbsp;
Sunday was irksome.&nbsp; The land was barren, from Dan to
Beersheba.&nbsp; I longed for the conflict and excitement and
life of the distant town, and I ran away unconscious of the pain
I should inflict on parents I dearly loved.&nbsp; Oh, that
running away!&nbsp; If I live&mdash;and there is little chance of
that&mdash;to the age of Methuselah I shall never forget
it!&nbsp; It took place in the early morn of a long
summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; The whole scene rises distinctly before
me.&nbsp; I see myself giving a note to my sister for father and
mother when they came down to breakfast, I see myself casting an
eye to the bedroom window to see if there was any chance of their
being up and so stopping the enterprise on which I had set my
mind.&nbsp; Happily, as I thought, the blinds were down and there
was nothing to forbid my opening the garden gate and finding
myself on the London road.&nbsp; I was anxious to be off and yet
loth to leave.&nbsp; I had a small parcel under my arm,
consisting of very small belongings; and I was free of Latin and
the Assembly Catechism, free as the air&mdash;my own
master.&nbsp; All the world was hushed in slumber.&nbsp; There
was no one to stop me or bid me return to the roof where I had
been happy, and to the parents whom I was to return to, to love
more than I had ever done before, and whom it then saddened me to
think that I might never see again.&nbsp; Not a soul was in the
street, and the few shops which adorned <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>it were shut
up&mdash;cottagers and shopkeepers, they were all in the arms of
Morpheus.&nbsp; I hastened on, not wishing to be seen by any one;
but there was no fear of that, only cows, horses at grass, and
pigs and hens and birds were conscious of my flight, and they
regarded me with the indifference with which a Hottentot would
view an ape.&nbsp; In my path was a hill on which I stayed awhile
to take a last look at the deserted village.&nbsp; The white
smoke was then curling up from the chimneys and the common round
of daily life was about to begin.&nbsp; How peaceful it all
seemed.&nbsp; What a contrast to my beating heart!&nbsp; There
was not one of those cottages behind into which I had not been
with my father as he visited the poor and the afflicted&mdash;not
a lane or street along which I had not trundled my hoop with
boyish glee&mdash;not a meadow into which I had not gone in
search of buttercups and cowslips and primroses or bird&rsquo;s
nests.&nbsp; I only met one man I knew, the miller, as he came
from the mill where he had been at work all night, and of him I
stood somewhat in awe, for once when the mill was being robbed he
had sat up alone in darkness in the mill till the robbers came
in, when he looked, through a hole in the upper floor, as they
were at their wicked work below, and had thus identified them;
and I had seen them in a cart on their way to Beccles gaol.&nbsp;
Perhaps, thought I, he <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>will stop me and ask me what I am
about; but he did nothing of the kind, and henceforth the way was
clear for me to London, where I was to fight the battle of
life.&nbsp; Did I not write poetry, and did not I know ladies who
were paid a guinea a page for writing for the Annuals, and could
not I do the same?&nbsp; And thus thinking I walked three miles
till I came to a small beershop, where I had a biscuit and a
glass of beer.&nbsp; The road from thence was new to me, and how
I revelled in the stateliness of the trees as I passed a
nobleman&rsquo;s (Earl Stradbrooke&rsquo;s) mansion and
park.&nbsp; In another hour or so I found myself at Yoxford, then
and still known as the Garden of Suffolk.&nbsp; There lived a Mr.
Bird, a Suffolk poet of some note in his day.&nbsp; On him I
called.&nbsp; He gave me a cordial welcome, kept me to dinner,
and set me to play with his children.&nbsp; Alas! Yoxford was to
me what Capua was to Hannibal&mdash;I got no further; in fact, my
father traced me to the house, and I had nothing for it but to
abandon my London expedition and return home.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think I was very sorry that my heroic enterprise had thus
miscarried.&nbsp; What annoyed me most was that I was sent home
in an open cart, and as we got into the street all the women came
to their doors to see Master James brought back.&nbsp; I did not
like being thus paraded as a show.&nbsp; I found my way to the
little attic in which I slept, not quite so <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>much of a
hero as I had felt myself in the early morn.</p>
<p>It was a stirring time.&nbsp; The nation was being stirred, as
it was never before or since, with the struggle for Reform.&nbsp;
The excitement reached us in our out-of-the-way village.&nbsp; We
were all Whigs, all bursting with hope.&nbsp; Yet some of the
respectable people who feared Sir Thomas Gooch were rather
alarmed by my father&rsquo;s determination to vote against
him&mdash;the sitting Member&mdash;and to support the Liberal
candidate.&nbsp; People do not read Parliamentary debates
now.&nbsp; They did then, and not a line was skipped.&nbsp; I was
a Radical.&nbsp; An old grocer in the village had lent me
Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;House that Jack Built,&rdquo; and similar
pamphlets, all illustrated by Cruikshank.&nbsp; My eyes were
opened, and I had but a poor opinion of royalty and the Tory
Ministers and the place men and parasites and other creeping
vermin that infest courts.&nbsp; It is impossible to believe
anything more rotten than that glorious Constitution which the
Tories told us was the palladium of our liberties, the glory of
our country, and the envy of surrounding nations.&nbsp; The
Ministry for the time being existed by bribery and
corruption.&nbsp; The M.P. bought his seat and sold his vote; the
free and independent electors did the same.&nbsp; The boroughs
were almost entirely rotten and for sale in consequence of the
complicated state of <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>voting in them, and especially in
those incorporated by charter.&nbsp; In one borough the right was
acquired by birth, in another by servitude, in another by
purchase, in a fourth by gift, in a fifth by marriage.&nbsp; In
some these rights were exercised by residents, in others by
non-residents; in one place by the mayor or bailiff and twelve
aldermen only, as at Buckingham, Malmesbury, &amp;c.; in another
by eight aldermen or ten or twelve burgesses, as at Bath,
Andover, Tiverton, Banbury, &amp;c.; in another by a small number
of burgesses&mdash;three or four or five, as at Rye, Winchelsea,
Romney, &amp;c.&nbsp; As to what was called long ago tenure in
boroughs there was no end to its absurdity.&nbsp; At Midhurst the
right was in the possession of a hundred stones erected in an
open field; at Old Sarum it was in the remaining part of the
possession of a demolished castle; at Westbury in a long
wall.&nbsp; In many other places it was in the possession of
half-a-score or a dozen old thatched cottages, the conveyances to
which were made on the morning of election to a few trusty
friends or dependents, who held a farcical election, and then
returned them to the proprietor as soon as the business was
finished.&nbsp; In the little borough of Aldeburgh, where Crabbe
was born, the number of electors was eighty, all the property of
a private individual; at Dunwich, a little further on the coast,
the number of voters was twelve; at Bury St. <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Edmunds the
number of voters was thirty-seven; another little insignificant
village on the same coast was Orford, where the right of election
was in a corporation of twenty individuals, composed of the
family and dependents of the Marquis of Hertford.&nbsp; No wonder
the popular fury swept away the rotten boroughs, and no wonder
that the long struggle for reform ended in the triumph, not so
much of the people, as the middle-class.</p>

<span class="smcap">Village Life</span>.</h2>
<p>In recalling old times let me begin with the weather, a matter
of supreme importance in country life&mdash;the first thing of
which an Englishman speaks, the last thing he thinks of as he
retires to rest.&nbsp; When I was a boy we had undoubtedly finer
weather than we have now.&nbsp; There was more sunshine and less
rain.&nbsp; In spring the air was balmy, and the flowers fair to
look on.&nbsp; When summer came what joy there was in the
hayfield, and how sweet the smell of the new-mown hay!&nbsp; As
autumn advanced how pleasant it was to watch the fruit ripening,
and the cornfields waving, far as the eye could reach, with the
golden grain!&nbsp; People always seemed gay and happy
then&mdash;the rosy-cheeked squire, the stout old farmer with his
knee-breeches and blue coat with brass buttons, and Hodge in his
smock-frock, white as the driven snow, on Sunday, when he went
now to his parish church, or more generally to the meeting-house,
where he heard sermons that suited him better, and where the
musical part of the service, by means of flute and bass violin
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>and clarionet, was ever a gratification and
delight.&nbsp; And even winter had its charms in the shape of
sliding and skating under a clear blue sky&mdash;all the trees
and hedges everywhere decked out with diamonds, ever sparkling in
the rays of an unclouded sun.&nbsp; We were all glad when the
snow came and covered the earth with a robe of white.&nbsp; We
were glad when it went away, and the birds began to build their
nests, and the plougher went forth to turn up the soil, which had
a fragrant savour after the wet and snow of winter, and the sower
went forth to sow, while the rooks cawed in the morning air as
they followed like an army in search of worms and whatever else
they could feed on, and the graceful swallow, under the eaves of
the old thatched cottage, built her clay nest, and lined it
carefully for the reception of the little ones that were to
come.&nbsp; They were always welcome, for in the opinion of the
villagers they brought good luck.&nbsp; Abroad in the meadows
there were the white woolly lambs, always at their gambols, and
leaping all over the meadows.</p>
<p>It was a great happiness to be born in a village.&nbsp; Our
village was rather a pretty one.&nbsp; Afar off we heard the
murmurs and smelt the salt air of the distant sea, and that was
something.&nbsp; There were no beerhouses then, and, alas! few
attractions to keep raw village <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>lads under
good influence.&nbsp; My father, as I have said, was a Dissenting
minister, painful, godly and laborious, ever seeking the
spiritual welfare of his people, and relieving as far as possible
their temporal wants.&nbsp; I had to accompany him in his
pastoral visits, sometimes an irksome task, as the poor were
numerous and garrulous, and made the most on such occasions of
the infirmities of their lot.&nbsp; Some of the old ones were so
worn and withered that their weird faces often haunted me by
night and terrified me in my dreams.</p>
<p>Another thing that gave me trouble was the fact of being a
Dissenter.&nbsp; It seemed to me a badge of inferiority, as the
ignorant farmers and tradesmen around made Nonconformity the
subject of deprecating remarks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dissenters were
sly,&rdquo; said the son of the village shopkeeper, the only boy
of my age in the village, whose father was the most servile of
men himself to the parochial dignitaries, and I felt that, as a
Dissenter, I was under a cloud.&nbsp; It was the fashion to call
us &ldquo;Pograms,&rdquo; and the word&mdash;no one knew what it
meant&mdash;had rather an unpleasant sound to my youthful
ears.&nbsp; This I knew, that most of the leading men of the
place went to church when they went anywhere, and not to our
meeting-house, where, however, we had good congregations.&nbsp;
Many of our people were farmers <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>who came from
a distance for the afternoon service, and at whose homes when the
time came I had many a happy day going out ferreting in the
winter and in the autumn riding on the fore-horse.&nbsp; As the
harvest was being gathered in, how proud was I to ride that
fore-horse, though I lost a good deal of leather in consequence,
and how welcome the night&rsquo;s rest after tumbling about in
the waggon in the harvest field.&nbsp; Happily did the morning of
my life pass away amidst rural scenes and sights.&nbsp; It is a
great privilege to be born in the country.&nbsp; Childhood in the
city loses much of its zest.&nbsp; Yet I had my dark
moments.&nbsp; I had often to walk through a small wood, where,
according to the village boys, flying serpents were to be seen,
and in the dark nights I often listened with fear and trembling
to the talk of the villagers of wretched miscreants who were to
be met with at such times with pitch-plaster, by means of which
they took away many a boy&rsquo;s life for the sake of selling
his dead body to the doctor for the purposes of dissection.&nbsp;
But the winter night had its consolations nevertheless.&nbsp; We
had the stories of English history by Maria Hack and other light
literature to read.&nbsp; We had dissecting maps to put together,
and thus acquire a knowledge of geography.&nbsp; And there was a
wonderful game invented by a French <i>abb&eacute;</i>, which was
played in connection with a teetotum and a <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>map of
England and Wales, the benefits of which even at this distance of
time I gratefully record.&nbsp; It is true cards were looked upon
as sinful, but we had chess and draughts.&nbsp; Later on we had
<i>The Penny Magazine</i>, and <i>Chambers&rsquo;s Journal</i>,
and <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, which had to me all the
fascination of a novel.&nbsp; We had also <i>The Evangelical
Magazine</i> and <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>, a magazine
which, I believe, has long ceased to exist, and the volumes with
illustrations of the Society for Diffusion of Useful and
Entertaining Knowledge, and we had the book club meetings, when
it was the fashion for the members to take tea at each
other&rsquo;s homes, and propose books, and once a year meet to
sell the old ones by auction.&nbsp; My father shone on such
occasions.&nbsp; He was a good talker, as times
went&mdash;conversation not being much of a gift among the
members of the club, save when the ladies cheered us with their
presence.&nbsp; As a Scotchman he had a good share of the dry
humour of his nation.&nbsp; But chiefly did he shine when the
brethren met.&nbsp; Foremost of the party were Sloper of Beccles,
who had talked on things spiritual with Mrs. Siddons, Crisp of
Lowestoft, Blaikie of Bungay, Longley of Southwold, and others,
who discussed theology and metaphysics all the evening, till
their heads were as cloudy as the tobacco-impregnated room in
which they sat.&nbsp; At all these gatherings Alexander Creak of
Yarmouth was a principal <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>figure; a
fine, tall, stately man, minister of a congregation supposed to
be of a very superior class.&nbsp; One of his sons, I believe,
still lives in Norfolk.&nbsp; As to the rest they have left only
their memories, and those are growing dimmer and fainter every
year.</p>
<p>At that time amongst the brethren who occasionally dawned upon
our benighted village were Mayhew of Walpole, good old Mr.
Dennant of Halesworth (of whom I chiefly remember that he was a
bit of a poet, and that he was the author of a couplet which
delighted me as a boy&mdash;and delights me
still&mdash;&ldquo;Awhile ago when I was nought, and neither
body, soul nor thought&rdquo;), and Mr. Ward of Stowmarket, who
was supposed to be a very learned man indeed, and Mr. Hickman of
Denton, whose library bespoke an erudition rare in those
times.&nbsp; Most of them had sons.&nbsp; Few of them, however,
became distinguished in after life; few of them, indeed, followed
their fathers&rsquo; steps as ministers.&nbsp; One of the Creaks
did, and became a tutor, I think, at Spring Hill College,
Birmingham; but the fact is few of them were trained for contest
and success in the world.&nbsp; As regards myself, I own I was
led to think a great deal more of the next world than of
this.&nbsp; We had too much religion.&nbsp; God made man to rule
the world and conquer it, to fight a temporal as well as
spiritual battle, to be diligent in business, whilst at the same
time fervent in spirit, <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>serving the Lord.&nbsp; What I
chiefly remember was that I was to try and be good, though at the
same time it was awfully impressed upon me that of myself I could
think no good thought nor do one good thing; that I was born
utterly depraved, and that if I were ever saved&mdash;a fact I
rather doubted&mdash;it was because my salvation had been decreed
in the councils of heaven before the world was.&nbsp; Naturally
my religion was of fear rather than of love.&nbsp; It seems to me
that lads thus trained, as far as my experience goes, never did
turn out well, unless they were namby-pamby creatures, milksops,
in fact, rather than men.&nbsp; I have lived to see a great
change for the better in this respect, and a corresponding
improvement of the young man of the day.&nbsp; It may be that he
is less sentimental; but his religion, when he has any, is of a
manlier type.&nbsp; I never saw a copy of Shakespeare till I was
a young man.&nbsp; As a child, my memory had been exercised in
learning passages from Milton, the hardest chapters in the Old or
New Testament, and the Assembly Catechism.&nbsp; If that Assembly
Catechism had never been written I should have been happier as a
child, and wiser and more useful as a man.&nbsp; I have led an
erratic life; I have wandered far from the fold.&nbsp; At one
time I looked on myself as an outcast.&nbsp; With the Old
Psalmist&mdash;with brave Oliver Cromwell&mdash;with generations
of tried souls, I had to sing, <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>as Scotch
Presbyterians, I believe, in Northern kirks still
sing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Woe&rsquo;s me that I in Meshec am<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sojourner so long,<br />
Or that I in the tents do dwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Kedar that belong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet nothing was simpler or more beautiful than the lives of
those old Noncons.; I may say so from a wide experience.&nbsp;
They were godly men, a striking contrast to the hunting,
drinking, swearing parsons of the surrounding district.&nbsp;
Hence their power in the pulpit, their success in the
ministry.&nbsp; But they failed to understand childhood and
youth; childhood, with its delight in things that are seen and
temporal, and youth with its passionate longing to burst its
conventional barriers, and to revel in the world which looks so
fair, and of which it has heard such evil.&nbsp; Ah, these
children of many prayers; how few of them came to be pious; how
many of them fell, some, alas, to rise no more.&nbsp; One reason
was that if you did not see your way to become a church member
and a professor of religion you were cut off, or felt inwardly
that you were cut off, which is much the same thing, and had to
associate with men of loose lives and looser thoughts.&nbsp;
There was no <i>via media</i>; you were either a saint or a
sinner, of the church or the world.&nbsp; It is not so now, when
even every Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association has its
gymnasium, and the young <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>man&rsquo;s
passions are soothed by temperance and exercise and not inflated
by drink.&nbsp; There may not be so much of early piety as there
was&mdash;though of that I am not sure.&nbsp; There is a great
deal more of religion than there was, not so much of sensational
enjoyment or of doctrinal discussion perhaps, but more practical
religion in all the various walks of life.</p>
<p>We had to teach in the Sunday-school.&nbsp; My services were
early utilised in that direction, for the village was badly
supplied with the stuff of which teachers were made, and as the
parson&rsquo;s son I was supposed to have an ex-officio
qualification for the task.&nbsp; I fear I was but a poor hand in
the work of teaching the young idea how to shoot, especially when
that idea was developed in the bodies of great hulking fellows,
my seniors in years and superiors in size.&nbsp; However, one of
them did turn out well.&nbsp; Many years after he recognised me
in the Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, London, where he had made money as
a builder, and where, though he never learned to
read&mdash;perhaps that was my fault&mdash;he figured for a time
largely on the walls as the Protestant churchwarden.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know, sir,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;how poor we
all were at W&mdash;&rdquo; (the father, I fear, was a drunkard),
&ldquo;Well, I came to London, resolving to be either a man or a
mouse&rdquo;; and here he was, as respectable-looking a man as
any you could see, thus proving what I hold to be the truth, that
in this <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>land of ours, however deep in the
mire a man may be, he may rise, if he has the requisite power of
work and endurance and self-denial.&nbsp; I fear he did not much
profit by our Sunday-school, though he told me he had put it down
in his will for a small legacy.&nbsp; Our chief man was a
shoemaker named Roberts, who sat with the boys under the pulpit
in face of all the people; the girls, with the modesty of the
sex, retiring to the back seats of the gallery.&nbsp; In his hand
he bore a long wand, and woe to the unfortunate lad who fell
asleep while the sermon was going on, or endeavoured to relieve
the tedium of it by eating apples, sucking sweets, or revealing
to his fellows the miscellaneous treasures of his pocket in the
shape of marbles or string or knife.&nbsp; On such an offender
down came the avenging stroke, swift as lightning and almost as
sharp.&nbsp; As to general education, there was no attempt to
give it.&nbsp; Later on, the Dissenters raised enough money to
build a day-school, and then the Churchmen were stirred up to do
the same.&nbsp; There was a school, kept by an irritable,
red-faced old party in knee-breeches, who had failed in business,
where I and most of the farmers&rsquo; sons of the village went;
but I can&rsquo;t say that any of us made much progress, and I
did better when I was taken back to the home and educated, my
father hearing my Latin and Greek as he smoked his pipe, while my
mother&mdash;a very <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>superior woman, with a great taste
for literature and art&mdash;acted as teacher, while she was at
work painting, after the duties of housekeeping were over.&nbsp;
I ought to have been a better boy.&nbsp; But there were two great
drawbacks&mdash;one, the absence of all emulation, which too
often means the loss of all worldly success; the other, the
painful and useless effort to be good.</p>
<h2><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<span class="smcap">Village Sports and Pastimes</span>.</h2>
<p>It was wonderful the utter stagnation of the village.&nbsp;
The chapel was the only centre of intellectual life; next to that
was the alehouse, whither some of the conscript fathers repaired
to get a sight of the county paper, to learn the state of the
markets, and at times to drink more ale than was good for
them.&nbsp; About ten I had my first experience of death.&nbsp; I
had lost an aged grandmother, but I was young, and it made little
impression on me, except the funeral sermon&mdash;preached by my
father to an overflowing congregation&mdash;which still lives in
my recollections of a dim and distant past.&nbsp; I was a small
boy.&nbsp; I was laid up with chilblains and had to be carried
into the chapel; and altogether the excitement of the occasion
was pleasing rather than the reverse.&nbsp; But the next who fell
a victim was a young girl&mdash;whom I thought
beautiful&mdash;who was the daughter of a miller who attended our
chapel, and with whom I was on friendly terms.&nbsp; On the day
of her funeral her little brothers and sisters came to our house
to be out of the way.&nbsp; But I could <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>not play with
them, as I was trying to realise the figure I thought so graceful
lying in the grave&mdash;to be eaten of worms, to turn to
clay.&nbsp; But I shuddered as I thought of what we so often
say:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are no acts of mercy past<br />
In the cold grave to which we haste,<br />
But darkness, death, and long despair<br />
Reign in eternal silence there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was sick at heart&mdash;I am sick at heart now&mdash;as I
recall the sad day, though more than seventy years have rolled
over my head since then.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the excitement of the Reform struggle.&nbsp;
It was to most of us a time of fear.&nbsp; A mob was coming from
Yarmouth to attack Benacre Hall, and then what would become of
Sir Thomas &ldquo;Guche&rdquo;?&nbsp; But older heads began to
think that the nation would survive the blow, even if Benacre
Hall were burnt and Sir Thomas &ldquo;Guche&rdquo; had to hide
his diminished head.&nbsp; As it happened, we did lose Sir
Thomas&rsquo;s services.&nbsp; He was thrown out for Suffolk, and
Mr. Robert Newton Shaw, a Whig, reigned in his stead.&nbsp; How
delighted we all were!&nbsp; Now had come the golden age, and the
millennium was at hand.&nbsp; Pensioners and place men were no
longer to fatten on the earnings of a suffering people, Radical
politicians even looked forward to the time when the parson would
lose his tithes.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>The villagers rarely left the village; they got work at
the neighbouring farms, and if they did not, they did not do so
badly under the old Poor Laws, which paid a premium to the
manufacturers of large families.&nbsp; The cottages were
miserable hovels then, as they mostly are, and charity had full
scope for exercise, especially at Christmas time, when those who
went to the parish church were taught the blessedness of serving
God and mammon.&nbsp; At one time the dear old chapel would hold
all the meetingers; but soon came sectarian divisions and
animosities.&nbsp; There was a great Baptist preacher at Beccles
of the name of Wright, and of a Sunday some of our people walked
eight miles to hear him, and came back more sure that they were
the elect than ever, and more contemptuous of the poor blinded
creatures who, to use a term much in common then, sat under my
father.&nbsp; Now and then the Ranters got hold of a barn, and
then there was another secession.&nbsp; Perhaps we had too much
theological disputation.&nbsp; I think we had; but then there was
nothing else to think about.&nbsp; The people had no cheap
newspapers, and if they had they could not have read them, and so
they saw signs and had visions, and told how the Lord had
converted them by visible manifestations of His presence and
power.&nbsp; Well, they were happy, and they needed somewhat to
make them happy amidst the abounding poverty and <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>desolation of their lives.&nbsp; By means of a
vehicle&mdash;called a whiskey&mdash;which was drawn by a mule or
a pony, as chance might determine, the family of which I was a
member occasionally visited Southwold, prettier than it is now,
or Lowestoft, which had no port, merely a long row of houses
climbing up to the cliff; or Beccles, then supposed to be a very
genteel town, and where there was a ladies&rsquo; boarding
school; or to Bungay, where John Childs, a sturdy opponent in
later years of Church rates and Bible monopoly, carried on a
large printing business for the London publishers, and cultivated
politics and phrenology.&nbsp; It was a grand outing for us
all.&nbsp; Sometimes we got as far as Halesworth, where they had
a Primitive meeting-house with great pillars, behind which the
sleeper might sweetly dream till the fiddles sounded and the
singing commenced.&nbsp; But as to long journeys they were rarely
taken.&nbsp; If one did one had to go by coach, and there was
sure to be an accident.&nbsp; Our village doctor who, with his
half-dozen daughters, attended our chapel, did once take a
journey, and met with a fall that, had his skull been not so
thick, might have led to a serious catastrophe.&nbsp; Then there
was Brother Hickman, of Denton, a dear, good man who never
stirred from the parish.&nbsp; Once in an evil hour he went a
journey on a stage coach, which was upset, and the consequence
was a long and dangerous illness.&nbsp; If home-keeping <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>youths have ever homely wits, what homeliness of wit we
must have had.&nbsp; But now and then great people found their
way to us, such as Edward Taylor, Gresham Professor of Music, who
had a little property in the village, which gave him a vote, and
before the Reform Bill was carried elections were elections, and
we knew it, for did not four-horse coaches at all times, with
flags flowing and trumpets blowing, drive through with outvoters
for Yarmouth, collected at the candidates&rsquo; expense from all
parts of the kingdom?&nbsp; In the summer, too, we had another
excitement in the shape of the fish vans&mdash;light four-wheel
waggons, drawn by two horses&mdash;which raced all the way from
Lowestoft or Yarmouth to London.&nbsp; They were built of green
rails, and filled up with hampers of mackerel, to be delivered
fresh on the London market.&nbsp; They only had one seat, and
that was the driver&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At the right time of year they
were always on the road going up full, returning empty, and they
travelled a good deal faster than the Royal mail.&nbsp; They were
an ever-present danger to old topers crawling home from the
village ale-house, and to dirty little boys playing marbles or
making mud pies in the street.&nbsp; Of course, there was no
policeman to clear the way.&nbsp; Policemen did not come into
fashion till long after; but we had the gamekeeper.&nbsp; How I
feared him as he caught me bird-nesting at an early hour in the
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Park, and sent me home with a heavy heart as he
threatened me with Beccles gaol.</p>
<p>In the winter I used to go out rabbiting.&nbsp; A young farmer
in our neighbourhood was fond of the sport, and would often take
me out with him, not to participate in the sport, but simply to
look on.&nbsp; It might be that a friend or two would bring his
gun and dog, and join in the pastime, which, at any rate, had
this advantage as far as I was personally concerned, that it gave
me a thundering appetite.&nbsp; The ferrets which one of the
attendants always carried in a bag had a peculiar fascination for
me, with their long fur, their white, shiny teeth, their little
sparkling black eyes.&nbsp; The ferret is popped into the hole in
which the rabbit is hidden.&nbsp; Poor little animal, he is
between the devil and the deep sea.&nbsp; He waits in his hole
till he can stand it no longer, but there is no way of escape for
him out.&nbsp; There are the men, with their guns and the dogs
eager for the fun.&nbsp; Ah! it is soon over, and this is often
the way of the world.</p>
<p>To us in that Suffolk village the sports of big schools and
more ambitious lads were unknown.&nbsp; For us there was no
cricket or football, except on rare occasions, when we had an
importation of juveniles in the house, but I don&rsquo;t know
that we were much the better for that.&nbsp; We trundled the
hoop, and raced one with another, and that is capital
exercise.&nbsp; We <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>played hopscotch, which is good
training for the calves of the legs.&nbsp; We had bows and arrows
and stilts, and in the autumn&mdash;when we could get into the
fields&mdash;we built and flew kites, kites which we had to make
ourselves.&nbsp; If there was an ancient sandpit in the
neighbourhood how we loved to explore its depths, and climb its
heights, and in the freshness of the early spring what a joy it
was to explore the hedges, or the trees of the neighbouring park,
when the gamekeepers happened to be out of sight in search of
birds&rsquo; nests and eggs; and in the long winter evenings what
a delight it was to read of the past, though it was in the dry
pages of Rollin, or to glow over the poems of Cowper.&nbsp; We
were, it is true, a serious family.&nbsp; We had family
prayers.&nbsp; No wine but that known as gingerbeer honoured the
paternal hospitable board.&nbsp; Grog I never saw in any
shape.&nbsp; A bit of gingerbread and a glass of water formed our
evening meal.&nbsp; Oh, at Christmas what games we had of
snap-dragon and blind man&rsquo;s buff.&nbsp; I always felt small
when a boy from Cockneydom appeared amongst us, and that I hold
to be the chief drawback of such a bringing up as ours was.&nbsp;
The battle of life is best fought by the cheeky.&nbsp; It does
not do to be too humble and retiring.&nbsp; Baron Trench owned to
a too great consciousness of innate worth.&nbsp; It gave him, he
writes, a too great degree of pride.&nbsp; That is bad, but not
so bad as <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the reverse&mdash;that feeling of
humility which withers up all the noblest aspirations of the
soul, and which I possessed partly from religion, and partly from
the feeling that, as a Dissenter, I was a social Pariah in the
eyes of the generation around.&nbsp; My modesty, I own, has been
in my way all through life.&nbsp; The world takes a man at his
own valuation.&nbsp; It is too busy to examine each particular
claim, and the prize is won by him who most loudly and
pertinaciously blows his own trumpet.&nbsp; At any rate, in our
Suffolk home we enjoyed</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lively cheer
of vigour born;<br />
The thoughtless day&mdash;the easy night&mdash;<br />
The spirits pure&mdash;the slumbers light&mdash;<br />
That fly the approach of morn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one drawback was the long-drawn darkness of the winter
night.&nbsp; I slept in an old attic in an old house, where every
creak on the stairs, when the wind was roaring all round, gave me
a stroke of pain, and where ghastly faces came to me in the dark
of old women haggard and hideous and woebegone.&nbsp; De Quincy
hints in his numerous writings at boyish times of a similar
kind.&nbsp; I fancy most of us in boyhood are tortured in a
similar way.&nbsp; Fuseli supped on pork chops to procure fitting
subjects for his weird sketches.&nbsp; But we never had pork
chops; yet in the visions of the night what awful faces I
saw&mdash;almost enough to turn one&rsquo;s brain and to make
one&rsquo;s <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>hair stand on end like quills upon
the fretful porcupine.</p>
<p>Country villages are always fifty years behind the times, and
so it was with us.&nbsp; In the farmyard there was no steam
engine, and all the work was done by manual labour, such as
threshing the corn with the flail.&nbsp; In many families the
only light was that of the rushlight, often home made.&nbsp;
Lucifer matches were unknown, and we had to get a light by means
of a flint and tinder, which ignited the brimstone match, always
in readiness.&nbsp; Cheap ready-made clothes were unknown, and
the poor mother had a good deal of tailoring to do.&nbsp; In the
cottage there was little to read save the cheap publications of
the Religious Tract Society, and the voluminous writings of the
excellent Hannah More, teaching the lower orders to fear God and
honour the king, and not to meddle with those that were given to
change.&nbsp; Her &ldquo;C&oelig;lebs in Search of a Wife&rdquo;
was the only novel that ever found its way into religious
circles&mdash;with the exception of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; and that was
awfully illustrated.&nbsp; Anybody who talked of the rights of
man at that time was little better than one of the wicked.&nbsp;
One of Hannah More&rsquo;s characters, Mr. Fantom, is thus
described:&mdash;&ldquo;He prated about <i>narrowness</i> and
<i>ignorance</i> (the derisive italics are Hannah&rsquo;s own),
and <i>bigotry</i> and <i>prejudice</i> and <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>priestcraft
on the one hand, and on the other of <i>public good</i>, the
<i>love of mankind</i>, and <i>liberality</i> and <i>candour</i>,
and above all of benevolence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dear Hannah made her
hero, of course, come to a shocking end, and so does his servant
William, who as he lies in Chelmsford gaol to be hung for murder
confesses, &ldquo;I was bred up in the fear of God, and lived
with credit in many sober families in which I was a faithful
servant, till, being tempted by a little higher wages, I left a
good place to go and live with Mr. Fantom, who, however, never
made good his fine promises, but proved a hard
master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another of Hannah&rsquo;s characters was a
Miss Simpson, a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter, who is always
exclaiming, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all for the best,&rdquo; though she
ends her days in a workhouse, while the man through whose
persecution she comes to grief dies in agony, bequeathing her
&pound;100 as compensation for his injustice, and declares that
if he could live his life over again he would serve God and keep
the Sabbath.&nbsp; And such was the literature which was to stop
reform, and make the poor contented with their bitter lot!</p>
<p>But the seed, such as it was, often fell on stony soil.&nbsp;
The labourers became discontented, and began more and more to
feel that it was not always true that all was for the best, as
their masters told them.&nbsp; They were wretchedly clad, and
lodged, and fed.&nbsp; Science, sanitary or otherwise, was quite
overlooked <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>then.&nbsp; The parson and the squire
took no note of them, except when they heard that they went to
the Baptist, or Independent, or Methodist chapel, when great was
their anger and dire their threats.&nbsp; Again Hannah More took
the field &ldquo;to improve the habits and raise the principles
of the common people at a time when their dangers and
temptations&mdash;social and political&mdash;were multiplied
beyond the example of any former period.&nbsp; The inferior ranks
were learning to read, and they preferred to read the corrupt and
inflammatory publications which the French Revolution had called
into existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! all was in vain.&nbsp; Rachel,
weeping for her children who had been torn from her to die in
foreign lands, fighting to keep up the Holy Alliance and the
right divine of kings to govern wrong, or had toiled and moiled
in winter&rsquo;s cold and summer&rsquo;s heat, merely to end
their days in the parish workhouse, refused to be
comforted.&nbsp; Good people grew alarmed, and goody tracts were
circulated more than ever.&nbsp; The edifying history of the
&ldquo;Shepherd of Salisbury Plain&rdquo; was to be seen in many
a cottage in our village.&nbsp; The shepherd earned a shilling a
day; he lived in a wretched cottage which had a hole in the
thatch which made his poor wife a martyr to rheumatism in
consequence of the rain coming through.&nbsp; He had eight
children to keep, chiefly on potatoes and salt, but he was happy
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>because he was pious and contented.&nbsp; A gentleman
says to him, &ldquo;How do you support yourself under the
pressure of actual want?&nbsp; Is not hunger a great weakener of
your faith?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the shepherd,
&ldquo;I live upon the promises.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, that was the
kind of teaching in our village and all over England, and the
villagers got tired of it, and took to firing stacks and barns,
and actually in towns were heard to cry &ldquo;More pay and less
parsons.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was the world coming to? said dear old
ladies.&nbsp; It was well Hannah More had died and thus been
saved from the evil to come.&nbsp; The Evangelicals were at their
wits&rsquo; end.&nbsp; They wanted people to think of the life to
come, while the people preferred to think of the life that
was&mdash;of this world rather than the next.</p>
<p>I am sure that in our village we had too much religion.&nbsp;
I write this seriously and after thinking deeply on the
matter.&nbsp; A man has a body to be cared for, as well as a soul
to be saved or damned.&nbsp; Charles Kingsley was the first to
tell us that it was vain to preach to people with empty
stomachs.&nbsp; But when I was a lad preaching was the cure for
every ill, and the more wretched the villagers became the more
they were preached to.&nbsp; There was little hope of any one who
did not go to some chapel or other.&nbsp; There was little help
for any one who preferred to talk of his wrongs or to <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>claim
his rights.&nbsp; I must own that the rustic worshipper was a
better man in all the relationships of life&mdash;as servant, as
husband, as father, as friend&mdash;than the rustic
unbeliever.&nbsp; It astonished me not a little to talk with the
former, and to witness his copiousness of Scripture phraseology
and the fluency of his religious talk.&nbsp; He was on a higher
platform.&nbsp; He had felt what Burke wrote when he tells us
that religion was for the man in humble life, to raise his nature
and to put him in mind of a State in which the privileges of
opulence will cease, when he will be equal by nature and more
than equal by virtue.&nbsp; Alas! we had soon Lord
Brougham&rsquo;s beershops, and there was a sad falling
away.&nbsp; Poachers and drunkards increased on every side.&nbsp;
All around there seemed to be nothing but poverty, with the
exception of the farmers&mdash;then, as now, always grumbling,
but apparently living well and enjoying life.</p>
<p>As one thinks of the old country years ago one can realise the
truth of the story told by the late Mr. Fitzgerald of a Suffolk
village church one winter&rsquo;s evening:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Congregation, with the Old Hundredth ready for the
parson&rsquo;s dismissal words.</p>
<p><i>Good Old Parson</i> (not at all meaning rhymes): The light
has grown so very dim I scarce can see to read the hymn.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span><i>Congregation</i> (taking it up to the first half of
the Old Hundredth):</p>
<p>The light has grown so very dim,<br />
I scarce can see to read the hymn.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Pause as usual.)</p>
<p><i>Parson</i> (mildly impatient): I did not mean to sing a
hymn, I only meant my eyes were dim.</p>
<p><i>Congregation</i> (to second part of the Old Hundredth):</p>
<p>I did not mean to read a hymn,<br />
I only meant my eyes were dim.</p>
<p><i>Parson</i> (out of patience): I did not mean a hymn at all,
I think the devil&rsquo;s in you all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious were the ways of the East Anglian clergy.&nbsp; One of
our neighbouring parsons had his clerk give out notice that on
the next Sunday there would be no service &ldquo;because master
was going to Newmarket.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one cared for the people,
unless it was the woman preacher or Methodist parson, and the
people were ignorant beyond belief.&nbsp; Few could either read
or write.&nbsp; It was rather amusing to hear them talk.&nbsp; A
boy was called bow, a girl was termed a mawther, and if milk or
beer was wanted it was generally fetched in a gotch.</p>
<p>Our home life was simple enough.&nbsp; We went early to bed
and were up with the lark.&nbsp; I was arrayed in a pinafore and
wore a frill&mdash;which I <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>abhorred&mdash;and took but little pleasure in my
personal appearance&mdash;a very great mistake, happily avoided
by the present generation.&nbsp; We children had each a little
bed of garden ground which we cultivated to the best of our
power.&nbsp; Ours was really a case of plain living and high
thinking.&nbsp; Of an evening the room was dimly lighted by means
of a dip candle which constantly required snuffing.&nbsp; To
write with we had the ordinary goose-quill.&nbsp; The room,
rarely used, in which we received company was called the
parlour.&nbsp; Goloshes had not then come into use, and women
wore in muddy weather pattens or clogs.&nbsp; The simple
necessaries of life were very dear, and tea and coffee and sugar
were sold at what would now be deemed an exorbitant price.&nbsp;
Postage was prohibitory, and when any one went to town he was
laden with letters.&nbsp; As little light as possible was
admitted into the house in order to save the window-tax.&nbsp;
The farmer was generally arrayed in a blue coat and yellow brass
buttons.&nbsp; The gentleman had a frilled shirt and wore Hessian
boots.&nbsp; I never saw a magazine of the fashions; nowadays
they are to be met with everywhere.&nbsp; Yet we were never dull,
and in the circle in which I moved we never heard of the need of
change.&nbsp; People were content to live and die in the village
without going half-a-dozen miles away, with the exception of the
farmers, who might drive <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>to the
nearest market town, transact their business, dine at the
ordinary, and then, after a smoke and a glass of brandy and water
and a chat with their fellow-farmers, return home.&nbsp; Of the
rush and roar of modern life, with its restlessness and eagerness
for something new and sensational, we had not the remotest
idea.</p>
<h2><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smcap">Out on the World</span>.</h2>
<p>In the good old city of Norwich.&nbsp; I passed a year as an
apprentice, in what was then known as London Lane.&nbsp; It was a
time of real growth to me mentally.&nbsp; I had a bedroom to
myself; in reality it was a closet.&nbsp; I had access to a cheap
library, where I was enabled to take my fill, and did a good deal
of miscellaneous study.&nbsp; I would have joined the
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, where they had debates, but the
people with whom I lived were orthodox Dissenters, and were
rather afraid of my embracing Unitarian principles.&nbsp; The
fear was, I think, groundless.&nbsp; At any rate, one of the most
distinguished debaters was Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett, afterwards
M.P., then in a lawyer&rsquo;s office; and another was his friend
Joseph Pigg, who became a Congregational minister, but did not
live to old age.&nbsp; Another of the lot&mdash;who was a great
friend of Pigg&rsquo;s&mdash;was Bolingbroke Woodward, who was, I
think, in a bank, from which he went to Highbury, thence as a
Congregational minister to Wortwell, near Harleston, and died
librarian <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>to the Queen.&nbsp; Evidently there
was no necessary connection, as the people where I lived thought,
between debating and embracing Unitarian principles.</p>
<p>Norwich seemed to me a wonderful city.&nbsp; I had already
visited the place at the time when it celebrated the passing of
the Reform Bill, when there was by day a grand procession, and a
grand dinner in the open air; where a friend, who knew what boys
liked, gave me a slice of plum pudding served up on the occasion;
and then in the evening there were fireworks, the first I had
ever seen, on the Castle Hill.&nbsp; It was a long ride from our
village, and we had to travel by the carrier&rsquo;s cart, drawn
by two horses, and sit beneath the roof on the top of the luggage
and baggage, for we stopped everywhere to pick up parcels.&nbsp;
The passengers when seated endeavoured to make themselves as
comfortable as circumstances would allow.&nbsp; Norwich at that
time had a literary reputation, and it seemed to me there were
giants in the land in those days.&nbsp; One I remember was the
Rev. John Kinghorn, a great light among the Baptists, and whom,
with his spare figure and primitive costume, I always confounded
with John the Baptist.&nbsp; Another distinguished personage was
William Youngman, at whose house my father spent a good deal of
time, engaged in the hot disputation in which that grand old
Norwich worthy always delighted.&nbsp; <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>As a boy, I
remember I trembled as the discussion went on, for</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. MacWinter was apt to be hot,<br />
And Mr. McKenzie a temper had got.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet their friendship continued in spite of difference of
opinion, and well do I remember him in his square pew in the Old
Meeting, as, with his gold-headed cane firmly grasped, the
red-faced fat old man sat as solemn and passionless as a judge,
while in the pulpit before him the Rev. Mr. Innes preached.&nbsp;
But, alas! the parson had a pretty daughter, and I lost all his
sermon watching the lovely figure in the pew just by.&nbsp;
Another of the deacons, tall and stiff as a poker, Mr.
Brightwell, had a pew just behind, father of a young lady known
later as a successful authoress, while from the gallery opposite
a worthy man, Mr. Blunderfield, gave out the hymn.&nbsp; Up in
the galleries there were Spelmans and Jarrolds in abundance,
while in a pew behind the latter was seated a lad who in after
life attained, and still retains, some fame as a lecturer against
Christianity, and later in its favour, well known as Dr.
Sexton.&nbsp; To that Old Meeting I always went with
indescribable awe; its square pews, its old walls with their
memorial marbles, the severity of the aspect of the worshippers,
the antique preacher in the antique pulpit all affected me.&nbsp;
But I loved the place nevertheless.&nbsp; Even now I am <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>thrilled as I recall the impressive way in which Mr.
Blunderfield gave out the hymns, and I can still remember one of
Mr. Innes&rsquo; texts, and it was always a matter of pride to me
when Mr. Youngman took me home to dinner and to walk on his lawn,
which sloped down to the river, and to view with wonder the
peacock which adorned his grounds.&nbsp; The family with which I
was apprenticed attended on the ministry of the Rev. John
Alexander, a man deservedly esteemed by all and beloved by his
people.&nbsp; He was a touching preacher, an inimitable
companion, and was hailed all over East Anglia as its
Congregational bishop, a position I fancy still held by his
successor, the Rev. Dr. Barrett.&nbsp; Dissent in Norwich seemed
to me much more respected than in my village home.&nbsp; Dr.
Brock, then plain Mr. Brock, also came to Norwich when I was
there, and had a fine congregation in St. Mary&rsquo;s, which
seemed to me a wonderfully fine chapel.&nbsp; I was always glad
to go there.&nbsp; Once I made my way to the Octagon, a still
nobler building, but my visit was found out by my master&rsquo;s
wife, and henceforth I was orthodox, that is as long as I was at
Norwich.&nbsp; The Norwich of that time, though the old air of
depression, in consequence of declining manufacture, has given
place to a livelier tone, in its essential features remains the
same.&nbsp; There are still the Castle and the old landmarks of
the Cathedral and the Market <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Place.&nbsp;
The great innovation has been the Great Eastern Railway, which
has given to it a new and handsome quarter, and the Colman
mustard mills.&nbsp; Outside the city, in the suburbs, of course,
Norwich has much increased, and we have now crowded streets or
trim semidetached villas, where in my time were green fields or
rustic walks.&nbsp; London did not dominate the country as it
does now, and Norwich was held to be in some quarters almost a
second Athens.&nbsp; There lived there a learned man of the name
of Wilkins, with whom I, alas! never came into contact, who had
much to do with resuscitating the fame of the worthy Norwich
physician, Sir Thomas Browne, immortal, by reason of his
&ldquo;Religio Medici&rdquo; and &ldquo;Urn Burial,&rdquo;
especially the latter.&nbsp; The Martineaus and the Taylors lived
there.&nbsp; Johnson Fox&mdash;the far-famed Norwich weaver boy
of the Anti-Corn League, and Unitarian minister, and subsequently
M.P. for Oldham&mdash;had been a member of the Old Meeting,
whence he had been sent to Homerton College to study for the
ministry, and a sister and brother, if I remember aright, still
attended at the Old Meeting.&nbsp; When I was a lad there still
might be seen in the streets of Norwich the venerable figure of
William Taylor, who had first opened up German literature to the
intelligent public; and there had not long died Mrs. Taylor, the
friend of Sir James Mackintosh <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>and other
distinguished personages.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was the wife,&rdquo;
writes Basil Montagu, &ldquo;of a shopkeeper in that city; mild
and unassuming, quiet and meek, sitting amidst her large family,
always occupied with her needle and domestic occupations, but
always assisting, by her great knowledge, the advancement of kind
and dignified sentiment.&nbsp; Manly wisdom and feminine
gentleness were united in her with such attractive manners that
she was universally loved and respected.&nbsp; In high thoughts
and gentle deeds she greatly resembled the admirable Lucy
Hutchinson, and in troubled times would have been specially
distinguished for firmness in what she thought
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Sayers was also one of the stars of the
Norwich literary circle, and I recollect Mrs. Opie, who had given
up the world of fashion and frivolity, had donned the Quaker
dress, and at whose funeral in the Quaker Meeting-house I was
present.&nbsp; The Quakers were at that time a power in Norwich,
and John Joseph Gurney, of Earlham, close by, enjoyed quite a
European reputation.&nbsp; It was not long that Harriet Martineau
had turned her back on the Norwich of her youth.&nbsp; The house
where she was born was in a court in Magdalen Street.&nbsp; But
it never was her dwelling-place after her removal from it when
she was three months old.&nbsp; Harriet was given to underrating
everybody who had any sort of reputation, and she certainly
underrated Norwich society, <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>which, when I
was a lad, was superior to most of our county towns.&nbsp; I
caught now and then a few faint echoes of that world into which I
was forbidden to enter.&nbsp; Norwich ministers were yet learned,
and their people were studious.&nbsp; A dear old city was
Norwich, with much to interest a raw lad from the country, with
its Cathedral, which, as too often is the case, sadly interfered
with the free life of all within its reach, with its grand Market
Place filled on a Saturday with the country farmers&rsquo; wives,
who had come to sell the produce of their dairy and orchard and
chickenyard, and who returned laden with their purchases in the
way of grocery and drapery; and its Castle set upon a hill.&nbsp;
It was there that for the first time I saw judges in ermine and
crimson, and learned to realise the majesty of the law.&nbsp;
Then there was an immense dragon kept in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
and it was a wonder to all as he was dragged forth from his
retirement, and made the rounds of the streets with his red eyes,
his green scales, his awful tail.&nbsp; I know not whether that
old dragon still survives.&nbsp; I fear the Reformers, who were
needlessly active in such matters, abolished him.&nbsp; But the
sight of sights I saw during my short residence at Norwich was
that of the chairing of the M.P.&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I forget who they
were; I remember they had red faces, gorgeous dresses, and silk
stockings.&nbsp; Norwich was a corrupt place, and a large <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>number of electors were to be bought, and unless they
were bought no M.P. had a chance of being returned.&nbsp; The
consequence was party feeling ran very high, and the defeated
party were usually angry, as they were sure to contend that they
had been beaten not by honest voting, but by means of bribery and
corruption, and thus when the chairing took place there was often
not a little rioting, and voters inflamed with beer were always
ready for a row.&nbsp; The fortunate M.P.&rsquo;s thus on
chairing days were exposed to not a little danger.&nbsp; The
chairs in which they were seated, adorned with the colours of the
party, were borne by strapping fellows quite able to defend
themselves, and every now and then ready to give a heave somewhat
dangerous to the seat-holder, who all the time had to preserve a
smiling face and bow to the ladies who lined the windows of the
street through which the procession passed, and to look as if he
liked it rather than not.&nbsp; The sight, however, I fancy,
afforded more amusement to the spectators than to the
M.P.&rsquo;s, who were glad when it was over, and who had indeed
every right to be, for there was always the chance of a collision
with a hostile mob, and a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> anything but
agreeable.&nbsp; But, perhaps, the sight of sights was Norwich
Market on Christmas Day, and the Norwich coaches starting for
London crammed with turkeys outside and in, and <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>only leaving
room for the driver and the guard.&nbsp; At that time London was
chiefly supplied with its turkeys from Norfolk, and it was only
by means of stage coaches that the popular poultry could be
conveyed.&nbsp; In this respect Norwich has suffered, for London
now draws its Christmas supplies from all the Continent.&nbsp; It
was not so when I was a lad, but from all I can hear Norwich
Market Place the Saturday before Christmas is as largely
patronised as ever, and they tell me, though, alas, I have no
practical knowledge of the fact, the Norwich turkeys are as good
as ever.&nbsp; As long as they remain so Norwich has little to
fear.&nbsp; I have also at a later time a faint recollection of
good port, but now I am suffering from gout, and we never mention
it.&nbsp; In these teetotal days &ldquo;our lips are now
forbidden to speak that once familiar word.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">At College</span>.</h2>
<p>What more natural than that a son should wish to follow in his
father&rsquo;s steps?&nbsp; I had a minister for a father.&nbsp;
It was resolved that I should become one.&nbsp; In Dissenting
circles no one was supposed to enter the ministry until he had
got what was denominated a call.&nbsp; I persuaded myself that I
had such a call, though I much doubt it now.&nbsp; I tried to
feel that I was fitted for this sacred post&mdash;I who knew
nothing of my own heart, and was as ignorant of the world as a
babe unborn.&nbsp; I was sent to a London college, now no more,
and had to be examined for my qualifications by four dear old
fossils, and was, of course, admitted.&nbsp; I passed because my
orthodoxy was unimpeachable, and I was to preach&mdash;I, who
trembled at the sound of my own voice, who stood in terror of
deacons, and who had never attempted to make a speech.&nbsp; I
hope at our colleges they manage these things better now, and
select men who can show that the ministry is in them before they
seek to enter the ministry.&nbsp; As it was, I found more than
one of my fellow-students was <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>utterly
destitute of all qualifications for the pastorate, and was simply
wasting the splendid opportunities placed within his reach.&nbsp;
The routine of college life was not unpleasant.&nbsp; We rose
early, attended lectures from our principal and the classes at
University College, and took part in conducting family service in
the hall.&nbsp; Occasionally we preached in the College chapel,
the principal attendant at which was an old tailor, who thereby
secured a good deal of the patronage of the students.&nbsp; By
attending the classes at University College we had opportunities
of which, alas! only a minority made much use.&nbsp; They who did
so became distinguished in after life, such as Rev. Joseph
Mullens, Secretary of the London Missionary Society; and John
Curwen, who did so much for congregational singing; Dr. Newth,
and Philip Smith, who was tutor at Cheshunt, and afterwards
Headmaster at Mill Hill.&nbsp; Nor must I forget Rev. Andrew
Reed, a preacher always popular, partly on his own and partly on
his father&rsquo;s account; nor Thomas Durrant Philip, the son of
the well-known doctor whose splendid work among the Hottentots is
not yet forgotten; nor Dr. Edkins, the great Chinese scholar; nor
the late Dr. Henry Robert Reynolds, who won for Cheshunt a
world-wide reputation.&nbsp; As regards myself, I fear I took
more interest in the debates at University College, where I made
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>acquaintance with men with whose names the world has
since become familiar, such as Sir James Stansfeld, Peter Taylor,
M.P. for Leicester, Professor Waley, of Jewish persuasion, C. J.
Hargreaves, Baron of the Encumbered Estates Court, and others who
seemed to me far superior to most of my fellow-students training
for the Christian ministry.&nbsp; I was much interested in the
English Literature Class under the late Dr. Gordon Latham, the
great Anglo-Saxon scholar, who would fain have had me Professor
in his place.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I look back with much pleasure on my college
career.&nbsp; We had two heads, neither of whom had any influence
with the students, nor did it seem to me desirable that they
should.&nbsp; One of them was an easy, pleasant, gentlemanly man,
who was pleased to remark on an essay which I read before him on
Christianity, and which was greeted with a round of applause by
my fellow-students, that it displayed a low tone of religious
feeling.&nbsp; Poor man, he did not long survive after
that.&nbsp; The only bit of advice I had from his successor was
as to the propriety of closing my eyes as if in prayer whenever I
went into the pulpit to preach, on the plea, not that by means of
it my heart might be solemnised and elevated for the ensuing
service, but that it would have a beneficial effect on the
people&mdash;that, in fact, on account of it they would think all
the better of <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>me!&nbsp; After that, you may be sure
I got little benefit from anything the good man might feel fit to
say.&nbsp; As a scholar he was nowhere.&nbsp; All that I
recollect of him was that he gave us
D&rsquo;Aubign&eacute;&rsquo;s History of the Reformation in
driblets as if we were rather a superior class of Sunday
scholars.&nbsp; Mr. Stowell Brown tells us that he did not
perceive that the members of his church were in any respect
better than those who were hearers alone.&nbsp; And to me
something similar was manifested in college.&nbsp; We pious
students were not much better than other young men.&nbsp; It
seemed to me that we were a little more lazy and flabby, that was
all.&nbsp; As a rule, few of us broke down morally, though such
cases were by no means rare.&nbsp; I cannot say, as M. Renan did,
that there was never a breath of scandal with respect to his
fellow-students in his Romanist Academy; but the class of young
men who had come to study for the ministry was not, with very
rare exceptions, of a high order, either in a religious or
intellectual point of view.&nbsp; In this respect I believe there
has been a great improvement of late.</p>
<p>My pulpit career was short.&nbsp; At times I believe I
preached with much satisfaction to my hearers; at other times
very much the reverse.&nbsp; De Foe writes: &ldquo;It was my
disaster first to be set apart for, and then to be set apart
from, the honour of that sacred employ.&rdquo;&nbsp; My
experience was something similar.&nbsp; I never had <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>a
call to a charge, nor did I go the right way to work to get
one.&nbsp; I felt that I could gladly give it up, and yet how
could I do so?&nbsp; I had a father whom I fondly loved, who had
set his heart on seeing me follow in his honoured steps.&nbsp; I
was what they called a child of many prayers.&nbsp; How could I
do otherwise than work for their fulfilment?&nbsp; And if I gave
up all thought of the ministry, how was I to earn my daily
bread?&nbsp; At length, however, I drifted away from the pulpit
and religious life for a time.&nbsp; I was not happy, but I was
happier than when vainly seeking to pursue an impossible
career.&nbsp; I know more of the world now.&nbsp; I have more
measured myself with my fellows.&nbsp; I see what ordinary men
and women are, and the result is&mdash;fortunately or not, I
cannot tell&mdash;that I have now a better conceit of
myself.&nbsp; I often wish some one would ask me to occupy a
pulpit now.&nbsp; How grand the position! how mighty the
power!&nbsp; You are out of the world&mdash;in direct contact
with the living God, speaking His Word, doing His work.&nbsp;
There in the pew are souls aching to be lifted out of themselves;
to get out of the mud and mire of the world and of daily life; to
enter within the veil, as it were; to abide in the secret place
of the Most High.&nbsp; It is yours to aid them.&nbsp; There are
those dead in trespasses and sins; it is yours to rouse
them.&nbsp; There are the aged to be consoled; the young to be
won over.&nbsp; Can <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>there be a nobler life than that
which makes a man an ambassador from God to man?</p>
<p>Yet they were pleasant years I spent at Coward College,
Torrington Square, supported by the liberality of an old wealthy
merchant of that name, the friend of Dr. Doddridge, and at
Wymondley&mdash;to which Doddridge&rsquo;s Academy, as it was
termed, was subsequently moved&mdash;where were trained, at any
rate, two of our most distinguished Nonconformists, Edward Miall
and Thomas Binney.&nbsp; I am sorry Coward College ceased to
exist as a separate institution.&nbsp; We were all very happy
there.&nbsp; We had a splendid old library at our disposal, where
we could learn somewhat of</p>
<blockquote><p>Many an old philosophy<br />
On Argus heights divinely sung;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and for many a day afterwards we dined together once a
year.&nbsp; I think our last dinner was at Mr. Binney&rsquo;s,
who was at his best when he gathered around him his juniors, like
himself, the subjects of old Coward&rsquo;s bounty.&nbsp; It was
curious to me to find how little appreciated was the good
merchant&rsquo;s grand bequest.&nbsp; I often found that in many
quarters, especially among the country churches, the education
given to the young men at Coward&rsquo;s was regarded as a
disqualification.&nbsp; It was suspected that it impeded their
religious career, that they were not so sound as good <!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>young men who did not enjoy these advantages, that at
other colleges the preachers were better because not so learned,
more devotedly pious because more ignorant.&nbsp; It was held
then that a student might be over-educated, and the more he knew
the more his religious zeal diminished.&nbsp; In these days the
feeling has ceased to exist, and the churches are proud of the
men who consecrate to the service of their Lord all their
cultivated powers of body and mind.&nbsp; The Christian Church
has ceased to fear the bugbear of a learned ministry.&nbsp; One
can quite understand, however, how that feeling came into
existence.&nbsp; The success of the early Methodists had led many
to feel how little need there was for culture when the torpor of
the worldly and the poor was to be broken up.&nbsp; The
Methodists were of the people and spoke to them in a language
they could understand.&nbsp; Learning, criticism,
doubt&mdash;what were they in the opinion of the pious of those
days but snares to be avoided, perils to be shunned?&nbsp; For
good or bad, we have outgrown that.</p>

<span class="smcap">London Long Ago</span>.</h2>
<p>In due time&mdash;that is when I was about sixteen years
old&mdash;I made my way to London, a city as deadly, as dreary as
can well be conceived, in spite of the wonderful Cathedral of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, as much a thing of beauty as it ever was, and the
Monument, one of the first things the country cousin was taken to
see, with the exception of Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s, then in Baker
Street.&nbsp; In the streets where the shops were the houses were
mean and low, of dirty red brick, of which the houses in the more
aristocratic streets and squares were composed.&nbsp; Belgravia,
with its grand houses, was never dreamt of.&nbsp; The hotels were
of the stuffiest character; some of them had galleries all round
for the sleeping chambers, which, however, as often as not were
over the stables, where the coach horses were left to rest after
the last gallop into London, and to be ready for the early start
at five or six in the morning.&nbsp; Perhaps at that time the
best way of coming into London was sailing up the Thames.&nbsp;
As there were few steamers then the number of <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>ships of
all kinds was much greater than at present, when a steamer comes
up with unerring regularity, discharges her cargo, takes in a
fresh one, and is off again without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp;
You saw Greenwich Hospital, as beautiful then as now, the big
docks with the foreign produce, the miles of black colliers in
the Pool, the Tower of London, the Customs House, and
Billingsgate, a very inconvenient hole, more famed for classic
language then than now.&nbsp; Yet it was always a pleasure to be
landed in the city after sitting all day long on the top of a
stage coach.&nbsp; In many ways the railway was but a poor
improvement on the stage coach.&nbsp; In the first place you
could see the country better; in the second place the chances
were you had better company, at any rate people talked more, and
were more inclined to be agreeable; and the third place, in case
of an accident, you felt yourself safer.&nbsp; As an old Jehu
said, contrasting the chances, &ldquo;If you have an accident on
a coach there you are, but if you are in a railway carriage where
are you!&rdquo;&nbsp; And some of the approaches to London were
almost dazzling.&nbsp; Of a winter&rsquo;s night it was quite a
treat to come into town by the East Anglian coaches, and to see
the glare of the Whitechapel butchers&rsquo; shops all lit up
with gas, and redolent of beef and mutton.&nbsp; It was wonderful
in the eyes of the young man from the country.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>The one great improvement in London was Regent Street,
from Portland Place and Regent&rsquo;s Park to the statue an
infatuated people erected to a shady Duke of York in Trafalgar
Square.&nbsp; Just by there was the National Gallery, at any rate
in a situation easy of access.&nbsp; Right past the Mansion House
a new street had been made to London Bridge, and there the
half-cracked King William was honoured by a statue, which was
supposed to represent the Royal body and the Royal head.&nbsp; In
Cornhill there was an old-fashioned building known as the Royal
Exchange, which kept alive the memory of the great civic
benefactor, Sir Thomas Gresham, and the maiden Queen; but
everywhere the streets were narrow and the houses mean.&nbsp;
Holborn Hill led to a deep valley, on one side of which ran a
lane filled with pickpockets, and cut-throats and ruffians of all
kinds, into which it was not safe for any one to enter.&nbsp; And
as you climbed the hill you came to Newgate Market, along which
locomotion was almost impossible all the early morning, as there
came from the north and the south and the east and the west all
the suburban butchers for their daily supply.&nbsp; Just over the
way on the left was that horror of horrors, Smithfield, where on
a market day some thousands of oxen and sheep by unheard of
brutality had been penned up, waiting to be purchased and let
loose mad with hunger and thirst and fright and pain all <!--
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>over the narrow streets of the city, to the danger of
pedestrians, especially such as were old and feeble.&nbsp;
Happily, St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital was close by, and the
sufferer had perhaps a chance of life.&nbsp; The guardians of the
streets were the new police, the Peelers or the Bobbies as they
were sarcastically called.&nbsp; The idiotic public did not think
much of them; they were the thin edge of the wedge, their aim was
to destroy the glorious liberty of every man, to do all the
mischief they could, and to enslave the people.&nbsp; Was not Sir
Robert Peel a Tory of the Tories and the friend of Wellington, so
beloved by the people that he had to guard his house with iron
shutters?&nbsp; At that time the public was rather badly off for
heroes, with the exception of Orator Hunt, who got into
Parliament and collapsed, as most of the men of the people
did.&nbsp; Yet I was a Liberal&mdash;as almost all Dissenters
were with the exception of the wealthy who attended at the
Poultry or at Walworth, where John and George Clayton
preached.</p>
<p>In the City life was unbearable by reason of the awful noise
of the stone-paven streets, now happily superseded by
asphalte.&nbsp; Papers were dear, but in all parts of London
there were old-fashioned coffee and chop houses where you could
have a dinner at a reasonable price and read the newspapers and
magazines.&nbsp; Peele&rsquo;s, in Fleet Street, at the corner of
Fetter Lane, was <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>a great place for newspapers and
reporters and special correspondents.&nbsp; Many a newspaper
article have I written there.&nbsp; Then there were no clubs, or
hardly any, and such places as the Cheshire Cheese, with its
memories of old Dr. Johnson, did a roaring trade far into the
night.&nbsp; There was a twopenny post for London, but elsewhere
the charge for letters was exorbitant and prohibitory.&nbsp; Vice
had more opportunities than now.&nbsp; There was no early
closing, and in the Haymarket and in Drury Lane these places were
frequented by prostitutes and their victims all night long.&nbsp;
A favourite place for men to sup at was Evans&rsquo;s in Covent
Garden, the Cider Cellars in Maiden Lane, and the Coal Hole in
the Strand.&nbsp; The songs were of the coarsest, and the
company, consisting of lords and touts, medical students, swell
mobsmen, and fast men from the City, not much better.&nbsp; At
such places decency was unknown, and yet how patronised they
were, especially at Christmas time, when the country farmer stole
away from home, ostensibly to see the Fat Cattle Show, then held
in Baker Street.&nbsp; Of course there were no underground
railways, and the travelling public had to put up with omnibuses
and cabs, dearer, more like hearses than they are now.</p>
<p>I should be sorry to recommend any one to read the novels of
Fielding or of Smollet.&nbsp; And yet in one sense they are
useful.&nbsp; At any rate, they show how much the England of
to-day is <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>in advance of the England of 150
years ago.&nbsp; For instance, take London.&nbsp; It is held that
London is in a bad way in spite of its reforming County
Council.&nbsp; It is clear from the perusal of Smollet&rsquo;s
novels that a purifying process has long been at work with regard
to London, and that if our County Councillors do their duty as
their progenitors have done, little will remain to be done to
make the metropolis a model city.&nbsp; &ldquo;Humphry
Clinker&rdquo; appeared in 1771.&nbsp; It contains the adventures
of a worthy Welsh Squire, Matthew Bramble, who in the course of
his travels with his family finds himself in London.&nbsp; The
old Squire is astonished at its size.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I left
open fields, producing corn and hay, I now find covered with
streets and squares, and palaces and churches.&nbsp; I am
credibly informed that in the space of seven years 11,000 new
houses have been built in one quarter of Westminster, exclusive
of what is daily added to other parts of this metropolis.&nbsp;
Pimlico is almost joined to Chelsea and Kensington, and if this
infatuation continues for half-a-century, I suppose, the whole
county of Middlesex will be covered with brick.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
prophecy that has almost come to pass in our time.&nbsp; At that
time London contained one-sixth of the entire population of the
kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that
our villages are depopulated and our farms in want of day
labourers.&nbsp; The villagers come up to London in the hopes of
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>getting into service where they can live luxuriously
and wear fine clothes.&nbsp; Disappointed in this respect, they
become thieves and sharpers, and London being an immense
wilderness, in which there is neither watch nor ward of any
signification, nor any order or police, affords them
lurking-places as well as prey.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old
Squire&rsquo;s complaint is to be heard every day when we think
or speak or write of the great metropolis.</p>
<p>The poor Squire writes bitterly of London life: &ldquo;I start
every hour from my sleep at the horrid noise of the watchmen
calling the hour through every street, and thundering at every
door.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I would drink water I must quaff the
mawkish contents of an open aqueduct, exposed to all manner of
defilement, or swallow that which comes from the Thames,
impregnated with all the filth of London and Westminster.&nbsp;
Human excrement is the least offensive part of the concrete,
which is composed of all the drugs, minerals and poisons used in
mechanics and manufactures, enriched with the putrefying carcases
of beasts and men, and mixed with the scourings of all the
washtubs, kennels, and common sewers within the bills of
mortality.&rdquo;&nbsp; The City churches and churchyards were in
my time constant sources of disease, and the chapels were, where
they had burying-grounds attached, equally bad.&nbsp; One need
not remark in this connection <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>how much
better off we are in our day.&nbsp; Again the Squire writes:
&ldquo;The bread I eat is a deleterious paste, mixed up with
chalk, alum and bone ashes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, again, we note
gladly a change for the better.&nbsp; The vegetables taste of
nothing but the dung-hills from whence they spring.&nbsp; The
meat the Squire holds to be villainously bad, &ldquo;and as for
the pork, it is an abominable carnivorous animal fed with
horseflesh and distillers&rsquo; grains, and the poultry is all
rotten in consequence of fever, occasioned by the infamous
practice of sewing up the guts, that they may be the sooner
fattened in crops in consequence of this cruel
restriction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then there is the butter, a tallowy,
rancid mass, manufactured with candle grease and butcher&rsquo;s
stuff.&nbsp; Well, these enormities are permitted no longer, and
that is a step gained.&nbsp; We have good water; the watchman is
gone, and the policeman has taken his place; but London as I knew
it was little better than it was in the Squire&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; I fear in eggs we have not improved.&nbsp; The old
Squire complains that they are imported from Scotland and
France.&nbsp; We have, alas! for our fresh eggs to go a good deal
further now.&nbsp; Milk, he tells us, was carried through the
streets in open pails, exposed to foul rinsings discharged from
doors and windows, and contaminated in many other ways too
horrible to mention.&nbsp; No wonder the old Squire longed to get
back to his old mansion <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>in Wales,
where, at any rate, he could enjoy pure water, fresh eggs and
real milk.&nbsp; It is hard to conceive how the abominations he
describes could have been tolerated an hour.&nbsp; There was no
Holborn Viaduct&mdash;nothing but a descent into a
valley&mdash;always fatal to horses, and for many reasons trying
to pedestrians.&nbsp; One of the sights of London which I sorely
missed was the Surrey Gardens, with its fireworks and
half-starved and very limited zoological collection.&nbsp; It has
long been built over, but many is the happy summer evening I have
spent there witnessing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, or some
other representation equally striking and realistic.&nbsp; In the
City Road there were tea-gardens, and at Highbury Barn was a
dancing establishment, more famous than those of the Eagle or
White Conduit Fields, and all at times made the scene of
political demonstrations and party triumphs.&nbsp; In this way
also were much celebrated the London Tavern and Freemasons&rsquo;
Hall.&nbsp; There was no attention paid to sanitation, and Lord
Palmerston had not horrified all Scotland by telling the clergy
who waited on him that it was not days of humiliation that the
nation wanted, but a more intimate acquaintance with the virtues
of soap and water.&nbsp; The clergy as a rule looked upon an
outbreak of disease, not as an illustration of the evils of want
and water and defective <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>drainage,
but as a sign of the Divine disgust for and against a nation that
had admitted Dissenters in Parliament, and emancipated the Roman
Catholics.&nbsp; Perhaps the greatest abomination of all was the
fearful custom which existed of burying the dead in the midst of
the living.&nbsp; The custom died hard&mdash;churches and chapels
made a lot of money in this way, careless of the fact that the
sickly odours of the vault and the graveyard filled up the
building where, on Sunday, men and women and children came to
worship and pray.&nbsp; Yet London got more country air than it
does now.&nbsp; The Thames was not a sewer, and it was all open
fields from Camden Town to Hampstead Heath, and at the back of
the Holloway Road, and such-like places.&nbsp; There was country
everywhere.&nbsp; As a whole, the London of to-day is a far
statelier city than the London of my earlier years.&nbsp;
Everything was mean and dirty.&nbsp; I miss the twopenny postman,
to whom I had always to entrust a lot of letters&mdash;when I
came up from my village home&mdash;as thus the writers save a
good sum of money on every letter.&nbsp; There were few
omnibuses, and they were dear.&nbsp; Old hackney coaches
abounded, and the cabs were few and far between, and very dirty
as well, all of which have immensely improved of late.&nbsp; The
cab in which I rode when I was set down by the coach at the White
Horse, Fetter Lane, then a much-frequented <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>hotel of
the highest respectability, was an awful affair, hooded and on
two high wheels, while the driver was perched on a seat just
outside.&nbsp; I was astonished&mdash;as well I might
be&mdash;when I got to that journey&rsquo;s end in safety.</p>
<p>In London and the environs everything was dull and
common-place, with the exception of Regent Street, where it was
tacitly assumed the force of grandeur could no further go.&nbsp;
There was no Thames Embankment, and only a collection of wharves
and coal agencies, and tumble-down sheds, at all
times&mdash;especially when the tide was out&mdash;hideous to
contemplate.&nbsp; The old Houses of Parliament had been burnt
down, and no costly palace had been erected on their site.&nbsp;
The Law Courts in Westminster Hall were crowded and
inconvenient.&nbsp; Where now Queen Victoria Street rears its
stately head were narrow streets and mean buildings.&nbsp;
Eating-houses were close and stuffy, and so were the inns, which
now we call by the more dignified name of hotels.</p>
<p>As to the poor sixty years ago, society was indifferent alike
as to the state of their souls or bodies.&nbsp; In Ratcliff
Highway the sailor was robbed right and left.&nbsp; The common
lodging-house was a den of thieves.&nbsp; The poor shirt-maker
and needlewoman lived on starvation wages.&nbsp; Sanitary
arrangements were unknown.&nbsp; There was no decency of any
kind; the streets, <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>or rather lanes, where the children
played, with their open sewers, were nurseries of disease.&nbsp;
Even in Bethnal Green, the Sanitary Commission found that while
the mean age of death among the well-to-do residents was
forty-four, that of the working-classes was twenty-two; and yet
Bethnal Green with its open spaces was a garden of Eden compared
with the lodging-houses in some of the streets off Drury
Lane.&nbsp; Perhaps the most unfortunate classes in the London of
that time were the poor chimney-sweeps&mdash;little children from
four to eight years of age, the majority of them orphans, the
rest bartered or sold by brutal parents.&nbsp; In order to do
their work they had to move up and down by pressing every joint
in their bodies against the hard and often broken surface of the
chimneys; and to prevent their hands and knees from streaming
with blood, the children were rubbed with brine before a fire to
harden their flesh.&nbsp; They were liable to a frightful
disorder&mdash;the chimneysweeper&rsquo;s cancer, involving one
of the most terrible forms of physical suffering.&nbsp; They
began the day&rsquo;s work at four, three, and even two in the
morning; they were half suffocated by the hot sulphurous air in
the flues; often they would stick in the chimneys and faint; and
then if the usual remedy&mdash;straw lighted to bring them
round&mdash;failed, they were often half killed, and sometimes
killed outright, by the <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>very means
used to extricate them.&nbsp; They lived in low, ill-drained,
ill-ventilated, and noxious rooms and cellars, and often slept
upon the soot heaps.&nbsp; They remained unwashed for weeks, and
on Sundays they were generally shut up together so that their
neighbours might not see their miserable condition.&nbsp; Perhaps
the worst part of London when I knew it was Field Lane, at the
bottom of Holborn Hill, now happily improved off the face of the
earth.&nbsp; It was known as &ldquo;Jack Ketch&rsquo;s
Warren,&rdquo; from the fact that the greater part of the persons
hanged at Newgate came from the lanes and alleys in the
vicinity.&nbsp; The disturbances that occurred in these low
quarters were often so great that from forty to fifty constables
armed with cutlasses were marched down, it being often impossible
for officers to act in fewer numbers or disarmed.&nbsp; Some of
the houses close beside the Fleet Ditch were fitted with dark
closets, trapdoors, sliding panels, and other means of escape,
while extensive basements served for the purpose of concealing
goods; and in others there were furnaces used by coiners and
stills for the production of excisable spirits.&nbsp; It was here
that in 1843 the Ragged School movement in London commenced its
wonderful and praiseworthy career.</p>
<p>Naturally in this connection I must speak of the Earl of
Shaftesbury, the great philanthropist of the Victorian era, a
nobleman whose long <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>and honourable life was spent in the
service of man and the fear of God.&nbsp; He was somewhat
narrow-minded, an Evangelical Churchman of a now almost extinct
type, not beloved by Cobden and the Free Traders, occasionally
very vehement in his utterances, a man who, if he had stuck to
the party game of politics, would have taken a high place in the
management of public affairs.&nbsp; I knew him well, and he was
always friendly to me.&nbsp; In his prime he must have been a
remarkably handsome man, tall, pale, with dark hair and a
commanding presence.&nbsp; Perhaps he took life a little too
seriously.&nbsp; To shake hands with him, said his brother, was a
solemn function.&nbsp; But his earnestness might well make him
sad, as he saw and felt the seriousness of the great work to
which he had devoted his life.&nbsp; He had no great party to
back him up.&nbsp; The Dissenters regarded him with suspicion,
for he doubted their orthodoxy, and in his way he was a Churchman
to the core.&nbsp; He was too much a Tory for the Whigs, and too
Radical a philanthropist for the old-fashioned Tory fossils then
abounding in the land.&nbsp; On one occasion Lord Melbourne, when
dining with the Queen in his company, introduced him to royalty
as the greatest Jacobin in her dominions.&nbsp; In Exeter Hall he
reigned supreme, and though dead he still lives as his works
survive.&nbsp; He was the friend of all the weak, the poor, the
desolate who needed help.&nbsp; <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>He did much
to arouse the aristocracy to the discharge of their duties as
well as the maintenance of their rights.&nbsp; All the world is
the better for his life.&nbsp; It was a miracle to me how his
son, the eighth Earl, came to commit suicide, as he always seemed
to me the cheerfullest of men, of the rollicking sailor
type.&nbsp; I often met him on board the steamer which took us
all down the river to the <i>Chichester</i> and <i>Arethusa</i>,
founded by the late Mr. William Williams in 1843&mdash;a good man
for whom Earl Shaftesbury had the most ardent esteem&mdash;as
refuges for homeless and destitute children to train up for a
naval career.</p>
<p>London poverty and London vice flourished unchecked till long
after Queen Victoria had commenced her reign.&nbsp; When I first
knew London the streets after dark were fearful, and a terrible
snare to all, especially the young and idle and well-to-do.&nbsp;
The public-houses were kept open till a late hour.&nbsp; There
were coffee-houses that were never closed; music-halls, where the
songs, such as described in Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cave of
Harmony,&rdquo; were of a most degrading character; Judge and
Jury Clubs, where the low wit and obscenity of the actors were
fearful; saloons for the pickpocket, the swell mobsman, and the
man about town, and women who shone in evening dress, and were
alike fair and frail.&nbsp; It is only within the last twenty
years that the Middlesex <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>magistrates
refused Mr. Bignell a licence for the Argyle Rooms; that was not
until Mr. Bignell had found it worth while to invest
&pound;80,000 in the place.&nbsp; Year after year noble lords and
Middlesex magistrates had visited the place and licensed
it.&nbsp; Indeed, it had become one of the institutions of the
metropolis, one of the places where Bob Logic and Corinthian
Tom&mdash;such men still existed, though they went by other
names&mdash;were safe to be found of an evening.&nbsp; The
theatre was too staid and respectable for them, though dashing
Cyprians, as they were termed, were sure to be found at the
refreshment saloon.&nbsp; When the Argyle was shut up, it was
said a great public scandal was removed.&nbsp; Perhaps so; but
the real scandal was that such a place was ever needed in the
capital of a land which handsomely paid clergymen and deans and
bishops and archbishops to exterminate the lust of the flesh, and
the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which found their
full development in such places as the Argyle Rooms.&nbsp; It was
a scandal and a shame that men who had been born in English
homes, and nursed by English mothers, and confirmed by English
bishops, and had been trained in English public schools and
Universities, and worshipped in English churches and cathedrals,
should have helped to make the Argyle Rooms a successful public
institution.&nbsp; Mr. Bignell created no public vices; he merely
pandered to <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>what was in existence.&nbsp; It was
the men of wealth and fashion who made the place what it
was.&nbsp; It was not an improving spectacle in an age that
sacrificed everything to worldly show, and had come to regard the
brougham as the one thing needful&mdash;the outward sign of
respectability and grace&mdash;to see equipages of this kind,
filled with fashionably dressed women, most of them</p>
<blockquote><p>Born in a garret, in a kitchen bred&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>driving up nightly to the Argyle, or the Holborn, or the
Piccadilly, or Bob Croft&rsquo;s in the Haymarket, with their
gallants or protectors or friends, or whatever they might term
themselves, amidst a dense crowd of lookers-on, rich or poor,
male or female, old or young, drunk or sober.&nbsp; In no other
capital in Europe was such a sight to be seen.&nbsp; It was often
there that a young and giddy girl, with good looks and a good
constitution, and above all things set on fine dresses and gay
society, and weary of her lowly home and of the drudgery of daily
life, learned what she could gain if she could make up her mind
to give her virtue; many of them, indeed, owing to the disgusting
and indecent overcrowding in rustic cottages and great cities
having but little virtue to part with.&nbsp; Then assailed her
the companionship of men of birth and breeding and wealth, and
the gaiety and splendour of successful vice.&nbsp; <!-- page
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>I
knew of two Essex girls, born to service, who came to town and
led a vicious life, and one became the wife of the son of a
Marquis, and the other married a respectable country solicitor;
the portrait of the lady I have often seen amongst the
photographs displayed in Regent Street.&nbsp; The pleasures of
sin, says the preacher, are only for a season, but a similar
remark, I fancy, applies to most of the enjoyments of life.&nbsp;
It is true that in the outside crowd there were in rags and
tatters, in degradation and filth, shivering in the cold, wan and
pale with want, hideous with intemperance, homeless and
destitute, and prematurely old, withered hags, whom the policemen
ordered to move on&mdash;forlorn hags, who were once
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the Argyle and the darlings of
England&rsquo;s gilded youth&mdash;the bane and the antidote side
by side, as it were.&nbsp; But when did giddy youth ever realise
that riches take to themselves wings and fly away, that beauty
vanishes as a dream, that joy and laughter often end in despair
and tears?&nbsp; The amusements of London were not much better
when the music-hall&mdash;which has greatly improved of
late&mdash;came to be the rage.&nbsp; One has no right to expect
anything intellectual in the way of amusements.&nbsp; People
require them, and naturally, as a relief from hard work, a change
after the wearying and wearisome drudgery of the day.&nbsp; A
little amusement is a necessity of our common humanity, whether
rich or poor, <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>saintly or the reverse.&nbsp; And,
of course, in the matter of amusements, we must allow people a
considerable latitude according to temperament and age, and their
surroundings and education, or the want of it; and it is an
undoubted fact that the outdoor sports and pastimes, in which
ladies take part as well as men, have done much to improve the
physical stamina and the moral condition of young men.&nbsp;
Scarcely anything of the kind existed when I first knew London,
and the amusements of the people chiefly consisted in drinking or
going to see a man hanged.&nbsp; At one time there were many
debating halls, where, over beer and baccy, orators, great in
their own estimation, settled the affairs of the nation, at any
rate, let us hope, according to their own estimation, in a very
satisfactory manner.&nbsp; In Fleet Street there was the Temple
Forum, and at the end, just out of it, was the Codgers&rsquo;
Hall, both famous for debates, which have long ceased to
exist.&nbsp; A glance at the modern music-hall will show us
whether we have much improved of late.&nbsp; It is more showy,
more attractive, more stylish in appearance than its
predecessors, but in one respect it is unchanged.&nbsp; Primarily
it is a place in which men and women are expected to drink.&nbsp;
The music is an afterthought, and when given, is done with the
view to keep the people longer in their places, and to make them
drink more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>you
think,&rdquo; said the manager of one of the theatres most warmly
patronised by the working classes, to a clerical friend of
mine&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think that I am doing good in
keeping these people out of the public-house all night?&rdquo;
and my friend was compelled to yield a very reluctant
consent.&nbsp; When I first knew London the music-hall was an
unmitigated evil.&nbsp; It was there the greenhorn from the
country took his first steps in the road to ruin.</p>
<h2><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span

<span class="smcap">My Literary Career</span>.</h2>
<p>I drifted into literature when I was a boy.&nbsp; I always
felt that I would like to be an author, and, arrived at
man&rsquo;s estate, it seemed to me easier to reach the public
mind by the press than by the pulpit.&nbsp; I could not exactly
come down to the level of the pulpit probationer.&nbsp; I found
no sympathetic deacons, and I heard church members talk a good
deal of nonsense for which I had no hearty respect.&nbsp; Perhaps
what is called the root of the matter was in me conspicuous by
its absence.&nbsp; I preached, but I got no call, nor did I care
for one, as I felt increasingly the difference between the pulpit
and the pew.&nbsp; Now I might use language in one sense, which
would be&mdash;and I found really was&mdash;understood in quite
an opposite sense in the pew.&nbsp; My revered parent had set his
heart on seeing me a faithful minister of Jesus Christ; and none
can tell what, under such circumstances, was the hardness of my
lot, but gradually the struggle ceased, and I became a literary
man&mdash;when literary men abode chiefly <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>in Bohemia,
and grew to fancy themselves men of genius in the low
companionship of the barroom.&nbsp; Fielding got to a phase of
life when he found he had either to write or get a living by
driving a hackney coach.&nbsp; A somewhat similar experience was
mine.</p>
<p>It is now about sixty years since I took to writing.&nbsp; I
began with no thought of money or fame&mdash;it is quite as well
that I did not, I am inclined to think&mdash;but a new era was
opening on the world, a new divine breath was ruffling the
stagnant surface of society, and I thought I had something to say
in the war&mdash;the eternal war of right with wrong, of light
with darkness, of God and the devil.&nbsp; I started a
periodical.&nbsp; In the prospectus I stated that I had started
it with a view to wage war with State Church pretensions and
class legislation.&nbsp; I sent some copies of it to Thomas
Carlyle&mdash;then rising into prominence as the great teacher of
his age.&nbsp; He sent me a short note back to the effect that he
had received and read what I had written, and that he saw much to
give his cordial consent to, and ended by bidding me go on and
prosper.&nbsp; Then I sent Douglas Jerrold a paper for his
<i>Shilling Magazine</i>, which he accepted, but never published
it, as I wanted it for a magazine which came out under my own
editorship.&nbsp; One of my earliest patrons was Dr. Thomas
Price, the editor of the <i>Eclectic</i>, who had formerly been a
Baptist minister, but who became secretary <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>of an
insurance society, and one of a founders of the Anti-State Church
Association, a society with which I was in full accord, and
which, as I heard Edward Miall himself declare, owed not a little
to my literary zeal.&nbsp; We had a fine time of it when that
society was started.&nbsp; We were at Leicester, where I stayed
with a dear old college friend, the Rev. Joseph Smedmore, and
fast and furious was the fun as we met at the Rev. James
Mursell&rsquo;s, the popular pastor of the Baptist Chapel, and
father of a still more popular son.&nbsp; Good company, good
tobacco, good wine, aided in the good work.&nbsp; Amongst the
company would be Stovel, an honoured Baptist minister Whitechapel
way, at one time a fighter, and a hard hitter to the end of his
lengthy life; John Burnett of Camberwell, always dry in the
pulpit, but all-victorious on the public platform, by reason of
his Scotch humour and enormous common-sense; Mursell in the
Midlands was a host in himself; and Edward Miall, whose
earnestness in the cause led him to give up the Leicester pulpit
to found the London <i>Nonconformist</i>.&nbsp; John Childs, the
well-known Bungay printer, assisted, an able speaker himself, in
spite of the dogmatism of his face and manner.&nbsp; When the
society became rich and respectable, and changed its name, I left
it.&nbsp; I have little faith in societies when they become
respectable.&nbsp; When on one occasion I <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>put up for
an M.P., I was amused by the emissary of the society sending to
me for a subscription on the plea that all the Liberal candidates
had given donations!&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that I am going to bid for your support by a paltry
&pound;5 note?&nbsp; Not, I, indeed!&nbsp; It is a pity
M.P.&rsquo;s are not made of sterner staff.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of
my intimate friends at one time was the late Peter Taylor, M.P.
for Leicester.&nbsp; He was as liberal as he was wealthy, yet he
never spent a farthing in demoralising his Leicester constituents
by charity, or, in other words, bribery and corruption.&nbsp; The
dirty work a rich man has to do to get into
Parliament&mdash;especially if he would represent an intelligent
and high-toned democracy&mdash;is beyond belief.</p>
<p>The ups and downs of a literary career are many.&nbsp; Without
writing a good hand it is now impossible to succeed.&nbsp; It was
not so when I first took to literature; but nowadays, when the
market is overstocked with starving genius in the shape of
heaven-born writers, I find that editors, compositors, readers,
and all connected with printing, set their faces rigidly against
defective penmanship.&nbsp; I look upon it that now the real
literary gent, as <i>The Saturday Review</i> loved to call him,
has ceased to exist altogether; there is no chance for him.&nbsp;
Our editors have to look out for articles written by lords and
ladies, and men and women who have achieved <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>some
passing notoriety.&nbsp; They often write awful stuff, but then
the public buys.&nbsp; A man who masters shorthand may get a
living in connection with the Press, and he may rise to be editor
and leader-writer; but the pure literary gent, the speculative
contributor to periodical literature, is out of the
running.&nbsp; If he is an honourable, if he is a lord or M.P.,
or an adventurer, creditable or the reverse, he has a chance, but
not otherwise.&nbsp; A special correspondent may enjoy a happy
career, and as most of my work has been done in that way, I may
speak with authority.&nbsp; As to getting a living as a London
correspondent that is quite out of the question.&nbsp; I knew
many men who did fairly well as London correspondents; nowadays
the great Press agencies keep a staff to manufacture London
letters on the cheap, and the really able original has gone clean
out of existence.&nbsp; Two or three Press agencies manage almost
all the London correspondence of the Press.&nbsp; It is an
enormous power; whether they use it aright, who can say?</p>
<p>I had, after I left college, written reviews and
articles.&nbsp; But in 1850 Mr. John Cassell engaged me as
sub-editor of the <i>Standard of Freedom</i>, established to
promote the sale of his coffees, or rather, in consequence of the
sale of them&mdash;to advocate Free Trade and the voluntary
principle, and temperance in particular, and philanthropy in
general.&nbsp; In time I became <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>chief
editor, but somehow or other the paper was not a success, though
amongst the leader writers were William Howitt and Robertson, who
had been a writer on the <i>Westminster Review</i>.&nbsp; It was
there also I saw a good deal of Richard Cobden, a man as genial
as he was unrivalled as a persuasive orator, who had a wonderful
facility of disarming prejudice, and turning opponents into
friends.&nbsp; I fancy he had a great deal of sympathy with Mr.
John Cassell, who was really a very remarkable man.&nbsp; John
Cassell may be described as having sprung from the dregs of the
people.&nbsp; He had but twopence-halfpenny in his pocket when he
came to town; he had been a carpenter&rsquo;s lad; education he
had none.&nbsp; He was tall and ungainly in appearance, with a
big head, covered with short black hair, very small dark eyes,
and sallow face, and full of ideas&mdash;to which he was
generally quite unable to give utterance.&nbsp; I was always
amused when he called me into his sanctum.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Ritchie,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;I want you to write a good
article on so-and-so.&nbsp; You must say,&rdquo; and here he
would wave his big hand, &ldquo;and here you must,&rdquo; and
then another wave of his hand, and thus he would go on waving his
hand, moving his lips, which uttered no audible sound, and thus
the interview would terminate, I having gained no idea from my
proprietor, except that he wanted a certain subject
discussed.&nbsp; At times <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>he had a
terrible temper, a temper which made all his friends thankful
that he was a strict teetotaler.&nbsp; But his main idea was a
grand one&mdash;to elevate morally and socially and
intellectually the people of whose cause he was ever an ardent
champion and true friend.&nbsp; He died, alas too soon, but not
till he saw the firm of Cassell, Petter, and Galpin one of the
leading publishing firms of the day.&nbsp; <i>The Standard of
Freedom</i> was incorporated with <i>The Weekly News and
Chronicle</i>, of which the working editor was Mr. John
Robinson&mdash;now Sir John Robinson, of <i>The Daily
News</i>&mdash;who was at the same time working editor of <i>The
Inquirer</i>.&nbsp; I wrote for <i>The Weekly
News</i>&mdash;Parliamentary Sketches&mdash;and for that purpose
had a ticket for the gallery of the House of Commons, where,
however, I much preferred to listen to the brilliant talk of
Angus Reach and Shirley Brooks, as they sat waiting on the back
bench to take their turns, to the oratory of the M.P.&rsquo;s
below.&nbsp; Let me not, however, forget my obligations to Sir
John Robinson.&nbsp; It was to him that I owed an introduction to
<i>The Daily News</i>, and to his kindness and liberality, of
which many a literary man in London can testify, I owe
much.&nbsp; Let me also mention that again I became connected
with Mr. John Cassell when&mdash;in connection with Petter and
Galpin&mdash;the firm had moved to Playhouse Yard, next door to
<i>The Times</i> printing office, and thence to the present <!--
page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>magnificent premises on Ludgate Hill.&nbsp; At that
time it became the fashion&mdash;a fashion which has been
developed greatly of late years&mdash;to print for country papers
a sheet of news, or more if they required it, which then was
filled with local intelligence, and became a local paper.&nbsp;
It was my duty to attend to the London paper, of which we printed
fresh editions every day.&nbsp; In that position I remained till
I was rash enough to become a newspaper proprietor myself.&nbsp;
Mr. John Tallis, who had made a handsome fortune by publishing
part numbers of standard works, was anxious to become proprietor
of <i>The Illustrated London News</i>.&nbsp; For this purpose he
desired to make an agreement with Mr. Ingram, M.P., the
proprietor of the paper in question, but it came to nothing, and
Mr. Tallis commenced <i>The Illustrated News of the
World</i>.&nbsp; When he had lost all his money, and was
compelled to give it up, in an evil hour I was tempted to carry
it on.&nbsp; It came to an end after a hard struggle of a couple
of years, leaving me a sadder and a wiser and a poorer man.&nbsp;
Once, and once only, I had a bright gleam of sunshine, and that
was when Prince Albert died, of whom and of the Queen I published
fine full-length portraits.&nbsp; The circulation of the paper
went up by leaps and bounds; it was impossible to print off the
steel plates fast enough to keep pace with the public demand, but
that was soon over, and the paper sank <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>accordingly.&nbsp; Next in popularity to the portraits
of Royalty I found were the portraits of John Bright, Cobden,
Spurgeon, and Newman Hall.&nbsp; For generals, and actors and
actresses, even for such men as Gladstone, or Disraeli, or
Charles Kingsley, the public at the time did not seem greatly to
care.&nbsp; But that was an episode in my career on which I do
not care to dwell.&nbsp; I only refer to it as an illustration of
the fact that a journalist should always stick to his pen, and
leave business to business men.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott tried to
combine the two, and with what result all the world knows.&nbsp;
In my small way I tried to do the same, and with an equally
disastrous result.&nbsp; Happily, I returned to my more
legitimate calling, which if it has not led me to fame and
fortune, has, at any rate, enabled me to gain a fair share of
bread and cheese, though I have always felt that another
sovereign in any pocket would, like the Pickwick pen, have been a
great blessing.&nbsp; Alas! now I begin to despair of that extra
sovereign, and fall back for consolation on the beautiful truth,
which I learned in my copy-book as a boy, that virtue is its own
reward.&nbsp; When I hear people declaim on the benefits the
world owes to the Press, and say it is a debt they can never
repay, I always reply, &ldquo;You are right, you can never repay
the debt, but I should be happy to take a small sum on
account.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is a great blessing to think and say
what you like, and that is a blessing <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>enjoyed by
the literary man alone.&nbsp; The parson in the pulpit has to
think of the pew, and if a Dissenter, of his deacons.&nbsp; The
medical man must not shock the prejudices of his patients if he
would secure a living.&nbsp; The lawyer must often speak against
his convictions.&nbsp; An M.P. dares not utter what would offend
his constituents if he would secure his re-election.&nbsp; The
pressman alone is free, and when I knew him, led a happy life, as
he wrote in some old tavern, (Peele&rsquo;s coffee-house in Fleet
Street was a great place for him in my day), or anywhere else
where a drink and a smoke and a chat were to be had, and managed
to evolve his &ldquo;copy&rdquo; amidst laughter and cheers and
the fumes of tobacco.&nbsp; His clothes were shabby, his hat was
the worse for wear; his boots had lost somewhat of their original
symmetry, his hands and linen were&mdash;but perhaps the less one
says about them the better.&nbsp; He had often little in his
pocket besides the last half-crown he had borrowed of a friend,
or that had been advanced by his &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; but he was
happy in his work, in his companions, in his dreams, in his
nightly symposium protracted into the small hours, in his
contempt of worldly men and worldly ways, in his rude defiance of
Mrs. Grundy.&nbsp; He was, in reality, a grander man than his
cultured brother of to-day, who affects to be a gentleman, and is
not unfrequently merely a word-grinding machine, who has been
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>carefully trained to write, whereas the only true
writer, like the poet, is born, not made.&nbsp; We have now an
Institute to improve what they call the social status of the
pressman.&nbsp; We did not want it when I began my journalistic
career.&nbsp; It was enough for me to hear the chimes at
midnight, and to finish off with a good supper at some Fleet
Street tavern, for as jolly old Walter Mapes sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Every one by nature hath a mould that he was cast
in;<br />
I happen to be one of those who never could write fasting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me return to the story of my betters, with whom business
relations brought me into contact.&nbsp; One was Dr. Charles
Mackay, whose poetry at one time was far more popular than
now.&nbsp; All the world rejoiced over his &ldquo;Good time
coming, boys,&rdquo; for which all the world has agreed to wait,
though yearly with less prospect of its realisation, &ldquo;a
little longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the editor of <i>The
Illustrated News</i> till he and the proprietor differed about
Louis Napoleon, whom Mackay held to be an impostor and destined
to a speedy fall.&nbsp; With Mr. Mackay was associated dear old
John Timbs, every one&rsquo;s friend, the kindliest of gossips,
and the most industrious of book-makers.&nbsp; Then there was
James Grant, of <i>The Morning Advertiser</i>, always ready to
put into print the most monstrous <i>canard</i>, and to fight in
the ungenial columns of the licensed victualler&rsquo;s organ to
the <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>bitter end for the faith once
delivered to the saints.&nbsp; And then there was marvellous
George Cruikshank, the prince of story-tellers as well as of
caricaturists to his dying day.&nbsp; It is curious to note how
great was the popularity of men whom I knew&mdash;such as George
Thompson, the M.P. for the Tower Hamlets and the founder of
<i>The Empire</i> newspaper&mdash;and how fleeting that
popularity was!&nbsp; Truly the earth has bubbles as the water
hath!&nbsp; Equally unexpected has been the rise of others.&nbsp;
Sir Edward Russell, of <i>The Liverpool Daily Post</i>, when I
first knew him was a banker&rsquo;s clerk in the City, which
situation he gave up, against my advice, to become the editor of
<i>The Islington Gazette</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Passmore Edwards, of
<i>The Echo</i>, at one time M.P. for Salisbury, and one of the
wisest and most beneficent of philanthropists, when I first knew
him was a struggling publisher in Horse Shoe Court, Ludgate Hill;
Mr. Edward Miall, M.P. for Bradford, the founder of <i>The
Nonconformist</i> newspaper and of the Anti-State Church
Association, as the Society for the Liberation of Religion from
State Patronage and Control loved to describe itself&mdash;(good
heavens, what a mouthful!)&mdash;was an Independent minister at
Leicester.&nbsp; How many whom I knew as pressmen are gone!&nbsp;
Of one of them I would fain recall the memory, and that is Mr.
James Clarke, of <i>The Christian World</i>, with whom it was my
privilege to be <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>associated many a long year.&nbsp;
In all my experience of editors I never knew a more honourable,
upright man, or one of greater clearness of head and kindliness
of heart.&nbsp; He died prematurely, but not till he had
revolutionised the whole tone of our popular theology.&nbsp; It
was an honour to be connected with such a man.&nbsp; He commenced
life as a reporter, and lived to be a wealthy man by the paper he
conducted with such skill.&nbsp; And what a friend he was to the
struggling literary man or reporter!&nbsp; I lay emphasis on
this, because my reviewers sometimes tell me I am cynical.&nbsp;
I ask, How can a man be otherwise who has been behind the scenes,
as I have been, for nearly fifty years?</p>
<p>One meets with curious characters among the gentlemen of the
Press.&nbsp; I recall the memory of one who was often to be seen
in Fleet Street at the time I was in Mr. Cassell&rsquo;s
employ.&nbsp; He was fair-haired, short and stout in figure, very
good-natured, with an amount of cheek only equalled by his
ignorance.&nbsp; Originally, I think he had been a printer, till
his ambition soon led him to fly at higher game, and under a
military <i>nom-de-plume</i> he compiled several handbooks of
popular games&mdash;games of which, by the bye, he knew as little
as a Hottentot&mdash;and, I believe, came to be the sporting
correspondent of a London paper&mdash;a position he held at the
time of his death.&nbsp; For statements that were rather <!--
page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>unreliable he had a capacity which almost bordered on
the sublime.&nbsp; On one occasion he walked up Ludgate Hill with
an acquaintance of my own, and nodded familiarly to certain
individuals.&nbsp; That was Dickens, he said to my friend, after
one of these friendly encounters.&nbsp; Of another he explained,
that was Thackeray, and so on.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, my
friend knew that the individual thus pointed was engaged as a
bookseller&rsquo;s assistant in the Row.&nbsp; Once when I
happened to meet him he was rather seedy, which he accounted for
to me by the remark that he had been dining with a lord&mdash;a
statement about as true as the generality of his remarks.&nbsp;
He was very good-natured&mdash;it was impossible to offend
him&mdash;and wrote touching poems in cheap journals about this
&ldquo;fog-dotted earth,&rdquo; which never did anybody any harm
so far as I was aware of.&nbsp; He was one of the numerous tribe
who impose on publishers by their swagger till they are found
out.&nbsp; Another of the same class was a gentleman of a higher
station and with scholarly pretensions.&nbsp; On one occasion he
served me rather a scurvy trick.&nbsp; I had published a volume
of sketches of British statesmen.&nbsp; One of the characters, a
very distinguished politician, died soon after.&nbsp; My
gentleman at that time was engaged to write biographical sketches
of such exalted personages when they died, and accordingly he
wrote an article which appeared the next day <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>in one of
the morning papers.&nbsp; On reading it, I found it was almost
word for word the sketch which I had written in my own book,
without the slightest acknowledgment.&nbsp; On my remonstrating,
he complained that the absence of acknowledgment was quite
accidental.&nbsp; Owing to the hurry in which he wrote, he had
quite forgotten to mention my name, and if I would say nothing
about it, he would do me a good service at the first
opportunity.&nbsp; My friend failed to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, I may
say that as a literary man his career was somewhat of a failure,
though he managed for a time to secure appointments on good
newspapers, and became connected with more than one or two
distinguished firms of publishers.&nbsp; He was known to many,
yet I never heard any one say a good word on his behalf.</p>
<p>I always avoided literary society.&nbsp; Perhaps in that
respect I did wrong as regards my own interest, for I find the
pressmen who belong to clubs are always ready to give each other
a helping hand in the way of good-natured reference, and hence so
much of that mutual admiration which forms so marked a feature in
the literary gossip of our day, and which is of such little
interest to the general reader.&nbsp; When I read such stuff I am
reminded of the chambermaid who said to a lady acquaintance,
&ldquo;I hear it is all over London already that I am going to
leave my lady,&rdquo; and of the footman who, being <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>newly married, desired his comrade to tell him freely
what the town thought of it.&nbsp; It is seldom that literary men
shine in conversation, and that was one reason I cared little to
belong to any of the literary clubs which existed, and I dare say
exist now.&nbsp; Dean Swift seems to have been of a similar
opinion.&nbsp; He tells us the worst conversation he ever
remembered to have heard in his life was that at Wells&rsquo;
Coffee House, where the wits, as they were termed, used formerly
to assemble.&nbsp; They talked of their plays or prologues or
Miscellanies, he tells us, as if they had been the noblest effort
of human nature, and, as if the fate of kingdoms depended on
them.&nbsp; When Greek meets Greek there comes, we are told, the
tug of war.&nbsp; When literary men meet, as a rule, the very
reverse is the case.&nbsp; I belonged to the Whittington
Club&mdash;now, alas! extinct&mdash;for it was the best
institution of the kind ever started in London, of which Douglas
Jerrold was president, and where young men found a home with
better society than they could get elsewhere, and where we had
debates, in which many, who have since risen to fame and fortune,
learned how to speak&mdash;perhaps a questionable benefit in
those days of perpetual talk.&nbsp; One of our prominent members
was Sir J. W. Russell, who still, I am happy to say, flourishes
as the popular editor of <i>The Liverpool Daily Post</i>.</p>
<p>As a writer, unpleasant experiences have been <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>few.&nbsp; I have had letters from angry
correspondents, but not more than two or three of them.&nbsp; One
of the most amusing was from a clergyman now deceased&mdash;a
very great man in his own opinion&mdash;a controversialist whom
none could withstand.&nbsp; Once upon a time he had a controversy
with the late Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, a man of whom I knew a
little, and for whose honesty I had a high regard.&nbsp; I was
present at the discussion, and in my account of it intimated
that, in my humble opinion, the clergyman was hardly the man to
grapple with Mr. Bradlaugh.&nbsp; I had a letter from the
clergyman thanking me in the name of all the devils in
hell&mdash;of whom he informed me I should shortly be
one&mdash;for the article I had written.&nbsp; On another
occasion a distinguished Congregational minister attacked me
bitterly in a journal that soon came to grief, which was intended
to supersede the newspaper with which it is my pride to have been
connected more than thirty-five years.&nbsp; I commenced an
action against him for libel; the reverend divine paid damages
into court, and I dropped the action.&nbsp; I had no wish to harm
the worthy divine, for such undoubtedly he was, by getting him
branded as a convicted libeller.&nbsp; I only wanted to teach him
that while in the pulpit a man was free to say what he liked, it
was quite a different thing to rush hastily and angrily into
print.&nbsp; One letter amused <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>me
rather.&nbsp; My usual signature was &ldquo;Christopher
Crayon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, as I had a paper under that signature,
I had written another with a different signature, which appeared
in the same issue, and immediately a correspondent wrote to
complain that the latter article was but a poor imitation of
&ldquo;Christopher Crayon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once a reviewer on a
leading London morning newspaper referred to me as a young
lady.&nbsp; I refer to that soft impeachment simply as an
illustration of the carelessness with which London reviewers
often write.&nbsp; I can quite understand such blunders.&nbsp; A
reviewer has so many books to look at, and such little time
allowed him for the right discharge of his duty, that it is no
wonder he often errs.</p>
<p>I have written several books.&nbsp; Perhaps here I ought to
refer to Mr. Burton, of Ipswich, who was the first to anticipate
the growing demand for good and cheap literature by the
publication of the &ldquo;Run and Read Library,&rdquo; which
deserved a better sale than it really secured.&nbsp; He published
my first book&mdash;a reprint of sketches of leading ministers of
all denominations, which had appeared in a London weekly paper,
and paid me for it in the most liberal manner.&nbsp; I fear Mr.
Burton was a little in advance of his age.&nbsp; At any rate, he
soon disappeared from Ipswich and the publishing trade.&nbsp;
Surely such a spirited town as Ipswich might have better
supported such a thoroughly <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>deserving
man.&nbsp; Possibly my experiences may be useful.&nbsp; One thing
is clear, that a review may one day praise you highly, and
another day as strongly condemn.&nbsp; How is this?&mdash;a
matter of personal prejudice say the public.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe it.&nbsp; Personal prejudice is not so common in reviews
as the ignorant public thinks.&nbsp; Accident has a great deal to
do with it.&nbsp; A newspaper proprietor once told me he had two
reviewers, one of whom always cut up all the books sent for
review, while the other praised them, and it depended upon the
chance into whose hands your book might fall, whether you were
praised or censured.&nbsp; Again, it is much easier to find fault
than to praise.&nbsp; A youthful reviewer is specially gratified
when he can &ldquo;slate&rdquo; an author, and besides how it
flatters his own self-esteem!&nbsp; It is true the reviewer in
doing so often blunders, but no one finds it out.&nbsp; For
instance, many years ago no man was better known in certain
circles than Mr. John Morley, the brother, the philanthropic
brother of that great philanthropist, Mr. Samuel Morley.&nbsp; I
had written in a book on City life that a certain portion of the
Gospels had been given away by Mr. John Morley on a certain
occasion.&nbsp; Our great Mr. John Morley was then only known to
a select few.&nbsp; The general public would perfectly understand
who was the Mr. John Morley to whom I referred.&nbsp; The
reviewer who deprecated <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>my book,
briefly, as somewhat gloomy&mdash;it had not become the fashion
then to expose the sores of City life&mdash;sneeringly observed
that it would be interesting if I would state what were the
portions of the Gospels given away by Mr. John Morley, evidently
ignorant that there could be any John Morley besides the one he
knew.&nbsp; I do not for a moment suppose that the reviewer had
any personal pique towards myself.&nbsp; His blunder was simply
one of ignorance.&nbsp; In another case it seemed to me that the
reviewer of a critical journal which had no circulation had
simply made his review a ground of attack against a weekly paper
of far greater circulation and authority than his own.&nbsp; I
had published a little sketch of travel in Canada.&nbsp; The
review of it was long and wearisome.&nbsp; I could not understand
it till I read in the closing sentence that there was no reason
why the book should have been reprinted from the obscure journal
in which it originally appeared&mdash;that obscure journal at the
time being, as it is to this day, one of the most successful of
all our weeklies.&nbsp; In his case the <i>motif</i> of the
ill-natured criticism was very obvious.</p>
<p>In some cases one can only impute a review of an unfavourable
character to what the Americans call &ldquo;pure
cussedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; For instance, I had written a book
called &ldquo;British Senators,&rdquo; of which <i>The Pall Mall
Gazette</i> had spoken in the highest terms.&nbsp; It fell into
the hands of the <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span><i>Saturday</i> reviewer when <i>The
Saturday Review</i> was in its palmy days, always piquant and
never dull.&nbsp; It was a fine opportunity for the reviewer, and
he wielded his tomahawk with all the vigour of the Red
Indian.&nbsp; I was an unknown man with no friends.&nbsp; It was
a grand opportunity, though he was kind enough to admit that I
was a literary gent of the Sala and Edmund Yates type (it was the
time when George Augustus Sala was at the bottom&mdash;the
<i>Saturday</i> took to praising him when he had won his
position), a favourable specimen if I remember aright.&nbsp; So
far so good, but the aim of the superfine reviewer was of course
to make &ldquo;the literary gent&rdquo; look like a fool.&nbsp;
As an illustration of the way in which we all contract our ideas
from living in a little world of our own, I said that I had heard
the late Mr. Joseph Sturge, of Birmingham, say at a peace meeting
at Edinburgh that there were more tears shed on the occasion of
the death of Mr. Bradshaw of the Railway Guide than when the Duke
of Wellington died.&nbsp; The <i>Saturday</i> reviewer exultingly
wrote &ldquo;Here is a blunder of Ritchie&rsquo;s; what Mr.
Sturge said, and what Ritchie should have said, was that there
were more tears shed when Mr. Braidwood of the Fire Brigade died,
than when the Duke of Wellington died.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt many
a reader of the <i>Saturday</i> chuckled over the blunder of
&ldquo;the literary gent&rdquo; thus held up to derision.&nbsp;
But unfortunately for <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>the <i>Saturday</i> reviewer, Mr.
Sturge died before Mr. Braidwood, and thus it was impossible that
he could have referred to the tears shed on the occasion of the
death of the latter.&nbsp; The laugh really ought to have been
the other way.&nbsp; But the mischief was done, &ldquo;the
literary gent&rdquo; snubbed, and that was all the
<i>Saturday</i> superfine reviewer cared about.</p>
<h2><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smcap">Cardiff and the Welsh</span>.</h2>
<p>In 1849 I lived at Cardiff.&nbsp; I had come there to edit
<i>The Principality</i>, a paper started, I believe, by Mr. David
Evans, a good sort of man, who had made a little money, which, I
fear, he lost in his paper speculation.&nbsp; His aim was to make
the paper the mouthpiece for Welsh Nonconformity.&nbsp; I must
own, as I saw how Cardiff was growing to be a big place, my aim
was to make the paper a good local organ.&nbsp; But the Cardiff
of that time was too Conservative and Churchified for such a
paper to pay, and as Mr. John Cassell offered me a berth on his
paper, <i>The Standard of Freedom</i>, my connection with Cardiff
came to an end.&nbsp; I confess I left it with regret, as I had
some warm friends in the town, and there was a charming little
blue-eyed maid&mdash;I wonder if she is alive now&mdash;the
daughter of an alderman and ex-mayor, with whom I had fallen
desperately in love for a time.</p>
<p>At that time Cardiff had a population of some 14,000.&nbsp;
Lord Bute had built his docks, not by any means as extensive as
they are now, and it was beginning to do an extensive trade in
coal <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>brought down by the Taff Vale
Railway.&nbsp; There was no rail to Cardiff then.&nbsp; To get to
it from London I had to take the rail to Bristol, spend the night
there, and go to Cardiff by the steamer which plied daily,
according to the state of the tide, between that port and
Bristol, at that time the commercial capital of the South Wales
district.&nbsp; The mails from London came by a four-horse coach,
which plied between Gloucester and Cardiff.&nbsp; I felt rather
miserable when I landed at the docks and looked at the sad
expanse of ground behind me and the Bristol Channel.&nbsp; A long
street led up to the town, with shabby houses on one side and a
large expanse of marshy land on the other.&nbsp; I had heard so
much of the romance of Wales that when I realised where I really
was my heart quite sank within me.&nbsp; At the end of St. Mary
Street was a very primitive old town hall, where I gave a lecture
on &ldquo;The Progress of the Nation,&rdquo; the only time I ever
gave a lecture in my life.&nbsp; The chairman was Mr. Vachell,
father of the late Dr. Vachell, an old resident in Cardiff, a man
of considerable eminence in the town&mdash;as he was supposed to
be very wealthy&mdash;and in the Cardiff of that day wealth was
regarded as the only claim to respect; he, at the end of my
lecture, expressed an opinion favourable to my talents, but at
the same time intimating that he had no sympathy with much I had
uttered.&nbsp; Especially he <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>differed
from me in the estimate I had given of the &ldquo;Rights of
Man,&rdquo; by Tom Paine.&nbsp; Once more I had an opportunity of
lifting up my voice in the Old Town Hall.&nbsp; It was on the
subject of Teetotalism.&nbsp; My opponent was a worthy, sturdy
teetotaler known as Mr. Cory, whose sons still flourish as the
great coal merchants of our day.&nbsp; Cardiff was a town of
publicans and sinners, and I am sorry to say I secured an easy
triumph; and Mr. Cory created great laughter as he said, in the
course of his oration, that if he were shut up in a cask he would
cry out through the bunghole, &ldquo;Teetotalism for
ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; He kept a place at the lower end of the town
to supply ships&rsquo; stores, and was in every way, as I
afterwards found by the friendship that existed between us, a
sterling character.</p>
<p>Just opposite the Town Hall, on the other side of the way, was
the Castle, then in a very neglected condition, with a large
enclosure which was open to the public as a promenade.&nbsp; The
street between them contained the best shops in the town.&nbsp;
It extended a little way to Crockherbtown on one side and to the
Cardiff Arms Hotel on the other, and then you were in the
country.&nbsp; Beyond the Cardiff Arms was a pleasant walk
leading to Llandaff Cathedral, then almost in a state of decay;
and to Penarth a charming hill, overlooking the Bristol Channel,
on the other, with a little old-fashioned <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>hotel; much
frequented in the summer.&nbsp; There was only one good house,
that built by Mr. Parry, of the firm of Parry and Brown, ship
brokers, where Mrs. Parry, a fine, handsome lady, dispensed
graceful hospitality.&nbsp; Her brother, Mr. David Brown,
afterwards removed to London to a fine office in Leadenhall
Street, and lived and died at a charming retreat he built for
himself in Harrow.&nbsp; There I one day met Lord Shaftesbury,
who came to a drawing-room meeting held in connection with the
London City Mission, and where we were all handsomely
regaled.</p>
<p>Perhaps at that time the most active man in Cardiff was Mr.
John Batchelor&mdash;whose statue, erected by his admirers, still
adorns the place&mdash;a sad thorn in the side of the
old-fashioned people who then ruled the town, especially the
Marquis of Bute&rsquo;s trustees or the men who represented them
in Cardiff.&nbsp; Mr. John Batchelor was a keen critic, a good
speaker, a sturdy Nonconformist, and a man of high character and
great influence.&nbsp; His death was a great loss to the
town.&nbsp; Just outside the town lived Mr. Booker, the
proprietor of tin-works at Velindra, a fine well-made man, and a
good speaker, who got into Parliament to maintain Protection, in
which attempt he failed.&nbsp; His admirers had a full portrait
of him painted by Mr. John Deffet Francis, who afterwards lived
in Swansea.&nbsp; Mr. Francis was a very versatile genius, and
got up <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>an amateur performance in which he
acted the part of a vagabond to perfection, somewhat to the
confusion of some of the ladies, who had never witnessed such a
realistic performance before.&nbsp; In connection with myself
quite a storm in a teacup took place.&nbsp; In St. Mary Street
there was an Athen&aelig;um, as the local reading-room was
called.&nbsp; It was thought by some of my friends that I ought
to be on the committee, but as I was not qualified a motion was
made to set the standing rules on one side in order that I might
be elected.&nbsp; The little town was quite excited on the
occasion, and the great Mr. Booker was appealed to to use his
influence against me, which he did, but I was elected
nevertheless.&nbsp; In my capacity of committee-man I did
something to get up some lectures, which were a great
success.&nbsp; One of the lecturers was Mr. George Dawson, with
whom I spent a pleasant day.&nbsp; Another was my old and comic
friend, Mr. George Grossmith, the celebrated father of a yet more
celebrated son.&nbsp; Another was Mrs. Balfour, the mother of the
Balfour who, in later times, was to do a lot of misdeeds and to
attain a very disagreeable notoriety in consequence.&nbsp; On
another occasion I was also enabled to do the town some service
by getting Mr. James Taylor, of Birmingham, to come and explain
his scheme for the formation of Freehold Land Societies, an idea
then in its infancy, but which has been for the social and <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>moral elevation of the working classes, who used to
spend in drink what they now devote to a better purpose.&nbsp;
There was a great deal of drinking in Cardiff.&nbsp; Indeed, it
was the chief amusement of the place.&nbsp; The sailors, at that
time consisting of representatives of almost every nation under
heaven, were much given to drinking, and some of the
boarding-houses were by no means of a respectable
character.&nbsp; There was no other form of social enjoyment
unless you belonged to the strict religious bodies who, as
Congregationalists, or Baptists, or Calvinistic Methodists, had
many chapels, which were well filled.&nbsp; It was in one of
these chapels Harry Vincent came to lecture when I was at
Cardiff, and electrified the town.</p>
<p>The Member of Parliament for the town lived a very quiet life,
and seemed to take but little interest in political
affairs.&nbsp; One of the most accomplished and certainly
best-educated men in the place was Mr. Chas. Bernard, architect
and surveyor; without him life would have been very dull to me at
Cardiff.&nbsp; I imagine that his chief reason for pitching his
tent in what must have been to him a very ungenial clime was that
his sister was married to the late Mr. Reece, local
Coroner.&nbsp; It grieves me to state that he has long since
joined the majority.&nbsp; Another great friend of mine was Mr.
Peter Price&mdash;now, alas! no more, who was destined, however,
to do much good before he passed away.&nbsp; The <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Public Library, which he did much to establish, still
retains his portrait.&nbsp; Another of the excellent of the earth
was Mr. W. P. James, the brother-in-law of Mr. Peter Price, who
came to Cardiff to build the new Town Hall.&nbsp; They were all
gentlemen who had come from a distance to settle in Cardiff, the
character of which they did much to improve and elevate.&nbsp; We
all did something to get up an Eisteddfod, which, if it did
nothing else, had this advantage, that it did something to
develop the powers of a Cardiff artist&mdash;Mr. D.
Marks&mdash;who, when I saw him last, had a studio in Fitzroy
Square, London, and was engaged to paint several portraits of
distinguished personages, one of these being a fine portrait of
the great and good Earl of Shaftesbury.&nbsp; It was presented to
his lordship at a great meeting held in the Guildhall, presided
over by the Lord Mayor, Sir William Macarthur, in April, in
1881.&nbsp; The committee of the Ragged School Union took the
initiative to do honour to their president.</p>
<p>As a newspaper man in Cardiff and a comparative stranger to
the town I had a somewhat unscrupulous opponent, the editor of
the local organ, <i>The Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian</i>.&nbsp;
He was a very unscrupulous man, apparently all smiles and
friendship, but I never could trust him.&nbsp; Nor was I
surprised to learn that when he became secretary of the Cardiff
Savings Bank there was a very serious defalcation in the <!--
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>funds.&nbsp; The man always seemed to me utterly
untrustworthy, but his civil manners apparently won him many
friends.&nbsp; As editor of a Liberal newspaper I had to fight
the battle under very great disadvantages.&nbsp; It was no easy
thing to run a newspaper then.&nbsp; The taxes on knowledge were
a great impediment.&nbsp; On every paper a penny stamp had to be
paid, and the advertisement duty was eighteenpence on every
advertisement.&nbsp; The repeal of these taxes was a great boon
for the local papers; and then there was a tax on paper, which
was an additional obstacle.&nbsp; As to telegraphs, they were
unheard of; and it was to the London dailies that we had to trust
for foreign news.&nbsp; One of the most important events when I
was at Cardiff was the opening of the South Wales Railway as far
as Swansea.&nbsp; The first train was driven by Mr. Brunel, the
eminent engineer, accompanied by a distinguished party of
directors and local magnates.&nbsp; I joined the train at
Cardiff.&nbsp; At Swansea the event was celebrated in grand
style.&nbsp; All the population seemed to me to have turned out
to witness the arrival of the train.&nbsp; There were flags and
decorations everywhere, and later on a grand banquet, at which I
was privileged to assist so far as eating and drinking and
cheering the speakers went.&nbsp; And thus my reminiscences
close.&nbsp; I cannot look back on my career at Cardiff with
unmixed satisfaction.&nbsp; I was by no means the steady old
party I have <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>since become.&nbsp; It is not always
easy to put an old head upon young shoulders, but at any rate in
my small way I did something for the advent of that brighter and
better day which has dawned not only upon Cardiff but on all the
land.</p>
<p>In this connection I may naturally add a few particulars of
worthy Welshmen I have known.&nbsp; The Scotchman who prayed that
the Lord would give them a good conceit of themselves, had he
lived among the Welsh, would have found that portion of his
prayer superfluous.&nbsp; It is to the credit of the Welsh that
they always have a good conceit of themselves.&nbsp; As a rule,
the world takes people at their own valuation, and the man who
assumes a superiority over his fellows&mdash;at any rate, till he
is found out&mdash;has his claim allowed.&nbsp; A Welshman has a
profound faith in his country and himself, especially as regards
oratory.&nbsp; There are no such preachers as those of Wales, and
I was quite amused when I first lived in Cardiff with the way in
which a Welshman, who lodged in the house where I had taken up my
abode, descanted on the gifts of Welshmen in London of whom I had
never heard, and I felt quite ashamed of my ignorance as he
rolled forth one Welsh name after another, and had to admit my
ignorance of the eminent men whose names he had at his
fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; Why, there were no such clever men
anywhere, according to his <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>account,
and yet I knew not the name of any of them!&nbsp; At the same
time I had come into contact with some Welshmen who had made
their mark in London.&nbsp; First on my list is that of Caleb
Morris, who preached in Fetter Lane Chapel, now in a declining
state, but at times filled with a large and very respectable
congregation.&nbsp; He was much given to discuss the objective
and subjective, a novelty to me at that time in pulpit
discourse.&nbsp; The state of his health latterly interfered with
his pulpit success; and before he died he had taken to preaching
in a room in Mecklenburg Square, where a large number of his
admirers flocked to hear him.&nbsp; He was an amiable and
thoughtful man, universally esteemed.&nbsp; Another Welshman of
whom I used to know more was the Rev. Henry Richard, who was then
a young man, preaching with a great deal of fire, in the
Congregational Chapel in the Marlborough Road, on the other side
of the water.&nbsp; He lived to become the popular M.P. for
Merthyr, and to be known all the world over as the advocate of
Peace.&nbsp; He was the secretary for many years of the Peace
Society.&nbsp; He became a successful platform speaker, and his
speeches were full of a humour which always told at public
meetings.&nbsp; Short and sturdy in build, he was always fit for
work, and had a long and laborious public life.&nbsp; He was a
Welshman to the core&mdash;always ready with his pen or tongue to
do battle for his <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>native land when aspersed by
ignorant or partisan writers, and he did much to help on the
Liberation Society, being after all a much more popular
speaker&mdash;especially in the House of Commons&mdash;than his
fellow-worker Edward Miall, and his loss to the Nonconformists
all over the land was very great.</p>
<p>But, after all, the Welshman with whom I was most intimate,
and whom I most admired, was Joseph Edwards, the sculptor.&nbsp;
He came from the neighbourhood of Merthyr, where he had many
relatives, whom he never forgot, and whose poverty he was always
ready to relieve.&nbsp; He had a studio in Robert Street,
Hampstead Road, and lived in the house close by.&nbsp; He had an
uphill work to fight, and to lead a life of labour and
self-denial, relieved by a few intervals of sunshine, as when at
a dinner party he had the privilege of meeting Mr.
Gladstone&mdash;or as when staying at the Duke of
Beaufort&rsquo;s, from whom he had a commission, he had the
honour of escorting the Duchess into the drawing-room&mdash;an
honour on which I never forgot to chaff him as I used to sit in
his studio watching him at work.&nbsp; He must have had to work
hard to make both ends meet; and when I went to see him on his
death-bed, as it proved to be, I was shocked with grief to see a
man of such rare and lofty genius have to sleep in a little room
at the very top of the house.&nbsp; But commissions were rare,
and the material on <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>which he had to work (marble) was
very costly, and the sculptor works at a great disadvantage
compared with the popular portrait painter.&nbsp; I believe he
derived a great part of his income by going to the studio of a
more successful artist, and giving finishing touches to what work
might be on hand, much to the astonishment of the assistants,
who, when they returned in the morning, were astonished to find
what progress had been made in the night, which they attributed
to the visitation of a ghost.&nbsp; Edwards was an enthusiastic
poet, and many of his works in plaster&mdash;waiting, alas! for
the commission to transfer to the marble which never
came&mdash;were exquisitely beautiful, and were often engraved in
<i>The Art Journal</i>.&nbsp; Both Mr. Hall, the editor, and his
wife, the clever authoress, were great admirers of Mr.
Edwards&rsquo; lofty and poetical idealisms, which sometimes
soared a little above my poor prosaic qualities.&nbsp; As I
listened to his rapt and ardent speech, I felt impelled somewhat
to make a few remarks to bring him down from his starry heights,
and the result ended in a hearty peal of laughter, for no man
better loved a joke.&nbsp; I have a medallion of myself which he
gave me after it had been exhibited at the Royal Academy, which I
cherish as the most beautiful work of art in my possession; but
he was too modest and retiring, and never gained the public
esteem to which he had an undoubted claim.&nbsp; I <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>was present at the unveiling of his fine marble bust of
Edith Wynne, then radiant in her glory as the Welsh Nightingale,
of whom I saw enough to learn that she was as charming in private
as in public life.&nbsp; The place was Hanover Square
Rooms.&nbsp; My friend Edwards received quite an ovation, the Sir
Watkin Wynne of that day presiding; but on the whole I fear that
Edwards by his genius did more for Wales than ever Wales did for
him.&nbsp; His life ought to have been written.&nbsp; Young men,
I am sure, would have learned many a useful lesson.&nbsp; He was
a true genius, with, as far as I could see, none of the failings
which by some are supposed to be associated with genius.&nbsp; It
was my painful privilege to be one of the mourners at his funeral
in Highgate Cemetery.&nbsp; His works he left to the Cymmrodorion
Society, where I hope that they are guarded with tender
care.&nbsp; South Wales has reason to rejoice in having had born
to her such a son.&nbsp; Let me mention another Merthyr man whom
I knew, who, if not such a genius as Joseph Edwards, had at any
rate as great an enthusiasm for the literature and language of
Wales.&nbsp; He was a chemist and druggist, named Stephens, and
found time to write a work on Wales, which was deemed worthy of
the prize offered on the subject by some Welshman of wealth and
position, whose name has, alas, escaped my treacherous <!-- page
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>memory.&nbsp; At that time Wales had failed to attract
much attention on the part of England.&nbsp; It was far away and
difficult to get at.&nbsp; Now and then an adventurous Englishman
made his way thither, and wrote a book to show how grand was the
scenery and hospitable the people, and how cheap it was as a
place of residence.&nbsp; But as a rule the average Englishman
knew as little of it as he did of Timbuctoo.&nbsp; Since then
Wales has learnt the art of advertising and is better known, and
that is an advantage not to be overlooked, for it is now all the
richer.&nbsp; Then few English resided there, and those chiefly
from motives of economy.</p>
<p>Another Welshman whom I had the honour to reckon as a friend
was Sir Hugh Owen, an earnest worker in the Temperance cause, and
for the social elevation of the people and righteousness.&nbsp;
In his case his high position on the Poor-Law Board was won by
merit, and by merit alone, as he entered the Department in a
subordinate capacity, and gradually worked his way up to the top
of the tree, not having the advantage of aristocratic birth and
breeding.&nbsp; I first met him in Claremont Chapel&mdash;a
Congregational place of worship in Pentonville&mdash;at one time
one of the most flourishing churches of that body, though I fear
it has somewhat declined of late.&nbsp; He was a man of kindly
speech and presence, always ready to help whatever <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>was worthy of help, and lived in the Holloway Road,
where I once spent with him a pleasant Sunday, and was much
charmed with one of his married daughters, who happened to be
there at the time.&nbsp; No Temperance gathering in general, and
no Welsh gathering in particular, was complete without Mr. Hugh
Owen, as he then was called.&nbsp; In all London there was no
more genial representative of gallant little Wales.&nbsp; He
lived to a good old age, beloved and respected.&nbsp; The last
time I met him was in the Farringdon Road, when he complained
that he felt a little queer in his head.&nbsp; My reply was that
he had no need to trouble himself on that account, as I knew many
people who were in the same condition who seemed to get on very
well nevertheless.</p>
<p>Another Welshman who yet lives&mdash;in a far-off
land&mdash;was Dr. Llewellen Bevan, the popular Congregational
minister in the beautiful city of Melbourne, where he is, as he
justly deserves to be, a great power.&nbsp; He commenced his
labours in London as co-pastor with Mr. Thomas Binney.&nbsp;
Thence he moved to Tottenham Court Chapel, which became very
prosperous under his popular ministry.&nbsp; From there he went
to America, where he did not remain long.&nbsp; He now lives in a
beautiful bungalow a few miles out of Melbourne, where I once
spent with him a very pleasant night, chatting of England and old
times.&nbsp; A curious memory occurs to me <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>in
connection with my visit to the reverend and popular divine at
Melbourne.&nbsp; On one occasion I heard him at a public meeting
in Tottenham Court Road Chapel declare, amidst the cheers of the
great audience, that he had given up smoking because one of his
people complained to him that her son had come home the worse for
liquor, which he had taken while smoking, and he thought there
could be no harm in smoking, because he had seen Mr. Bevan
smoking.&nbsp; &ldquo;From that hour,&rdquo; said Mr. Bevan,
amidst prolonged applause, &ldquo;I resolved to give up
smoking,&rdquo; and the deacons looked at me to see if I was not
ashamed of my indulgence in a habit which in the case alluded to
had produced such disastrous results.&nbsp; I must own that the
reason adduced by the reverend gentleman was not to me
convincing, for as far as my experience goes the smoker
infinitely prefers a cup of coffee with his cigar or pipe to any
amount of alcoholic liquor.&nbsp; Judge, then, of my surprise
when at Melbourne, after our evening meal, Mr. Bevan proposed to
me that we should adjourn to his study and have a smoke&mdash;an
invitation with which I gladly complied.&nbsp; After my
recollection of the scene in the London chapel I was glad to find
the Doctor, as regards tobacco, sober and in his right
mind.&nbsp; Long may he be spared after the labours of his busy
life to soothe his wearied mind with the solace of the
weed!&nbsp; The Doctor has a noble <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>presence,
and seemed to me when I saw him last to be getting in face more
and more like England&rsquo;s greatest orator&mdash;as regards
latter days&mdash;Mr. John Bright.&nbsp; In his far-away home he
seemed to me to retain his love for Wales and the sense of the
superiority of the Welshman to any one on the face of the
earth.&nbsp; The Doctor is an ardent Gladstonite&mdash;and people
of that way of thinking are not quite as numerous in the Colonies
as they are at home.</p>
<p>Another Welshman who made his mark in London was the Rev. Dr.
Thomas, a Congregational minister at Stockwell, a fine-looking
young man when I first knew him as a minister at Chesham.&nbsp;
He developed the faculty of his countrymen for lofty ideas and
aims to an extent that ended in disastrous failure.&nbsp; It was
he who originated the idea of <i>The Dial</i>&mdash;which was to
be a daily to advocate righteousness, and to beat down and to
supplant <i>The Times</i>.&nbsp; The motto was to be
&ldquo;Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to
any people.&rdquo;&nbsp; He got a great many people to take
shares, and commenced the publication of <i>The Dial</i> in the
first place as a weekly.&nbsp; But the paper was a failure from
the first.&nbsp; Another idea of his was to raise a million to
build workmen&rsquo;s institutes and recreation halls all over
the kingdom, but as the late Earl of Derby, when appealed to on
the subject, replied, it carried its own condemnation in the face
of it.&nbsp; A society, <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>however,
was started, but it never came to much.&nbsp; The real fact is
that institutions established for working men, not by them, are
rarely a success.&nbsp; Dr. Thomas also claimed to have started
the idea of the University for Wales, and was very angry with me
when I, after some inquiry, failed to support his claim.&nbsp;
His great success was the publication of a magazine for
preachers, under the title of <i>The Homilist</i>.&nbsp; The
writer was a great man, not so much so, perhaps, as he thought,
and had his full share of Welsh enthusiasm and fire.&nbsp; But he
made a terrible blunder over his <i>Dial</i> scheme.&nbsp; He had
done better had he kept to the pulpit.&nbsp; Parsons are not
always practical, and the management of successful daily
newspapers is not exactly in their line.&nbsp; The shoemaker
should stick to his last; but in spite of Welsh poetic geniuses,
the great fact which always strikes men in London is the
commercial successes of the Welshmen who venture to try their
fortune on the metropolitan stage.&nbsp; This especially strikes
me with regard to the drapery trade.&nbsp; Many of the largest
establishments in that way are owned at this present time by
Welshmen&mdash;such as Jones, of Holloway; Evans, of Oxford
Street, and many more.&nbsp; Few of them had capital or friends
to help them, yet few men have done better in the pleasant art of
money-making&mdash;an art rare, alas! to the class to which I
have the honour to belong.</p>
<h2><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smcap">A Great National Movement</span>.</h2>
<p>One national movement in which I took a prominent part was the
formation of freehold land societies, which commenced somewhere
about 1850, and at which <i>The Times</i>, after its manner in
those days, sneered, asking scornfully what was a freehold land
society.&nbsp; The apostle of the new movement, which was to
teach the British working man how to save money and buy a bit of
land on which to build a house and secure a vote, was Mr. James
Taylor, born in Birmingham in 1814.&nbsp; Like all other
Birmingham boys, James was early set to work, and became an
apprentice in one of the fancy trades for which Birmingham was
famed.&nbsp; His industrious habits soon acquired for him the
approbation of his master, who, on retiring from business before
Taylor was of age, gave him his indentures.&nbsp; About that time
Taylor, earning good wages and not having the fear of Malthus
before his eyes, got married and lived happily till, like too
many of his class, he took to drink.&nbsp; After years of utter
misery and degradation, Taylor, in a happy hour for himself and
society, <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>took the temperance pledge and
became a new man.&nbsp; Nor was he satisfied with his own reform
alone.&nbsp; He was anxious that others should be rescued from
degradation as he had been.&nbsp; For this purpose he identified
himself with the Temperance cause, and was honorary secretary to
the Birmingham Temperance Society till he became the leader and
originator of the Freehold Land Movement, and then for years his
life was given to the public.&nbsp; He had but one speech, but it
was a racy one, and his voice was soon lifted up in every town in
the land.&nbsp; The plan pursued was to buy an estate, cut it up
into allotments, and offer them almost free of legal
expense.&nbsp; There never was such a chance for the working man
as an investment, and thousands availed themselves of
it&mdash;and were all the better for it&mdash;especially those
who to pay their small subscriptions became teetotalers and gave
up drink.&nbsp; And yet a learned writer in <i>The Edinburgh
Review</i> had the audacity to write, &ldquo;Notwithstanding this
rapid popularity, however, notwithstanding also the high
authorities which have been quoted on their behalf, we cannot
look on these associations with unmixed favour, and we shall not
be surprised if any long time elapses without well-grounded
disappointment and discontent arising among their members.&nbsp;
However desirable it may be for a peasant or an artisan to be
possessor of the garden which he cultivates and of <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>the house he dwells in, however clear and great the
gain to him in this case, it is by no means equally certain that
he can derive any pecuniary advantage from the possession of a
plot of ground which is too far from his daily work for him
either to erect a dwelling on it or to cultivate it as an
allotment, and which from its diminutive size he will find it
difficult for him to let for any sufficient remuneration.&nbsp;
In many cases a barren site will be his only reward for &pound;50
of saving, and however he may value this in times of excitement
it will in three elections out of four be of little real interest
or moment to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happily the working men knew
better than the <i>Edinburgh</i> reviewer, and the societies
flourished all the more.&nbsp; The Conservatives were, of course,
utterly indignant at this wholesale manufacture of faggot votes,
as they were contemptuously termed, which threatened the seats of
so many respectable Conservative county members, but in the end
they thought better of it, and actually started a Conservative
Freehold Land Society themselves, a fact announced to me in a
letter from Mr. Cobden, which I have or ought to have somewhere
in my possession.&nbsp; The societies increased so greatly that a
journal was started by Mr. Cassell, called <i>The Freeholder</i>,
of which I was editor, and was the means of often bringing me
into contact with Mr. Cobden, a man with whom no one ever came in
contact without <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>feeling for him the most ardent
admiration.&nbsp; At one time I saw a good deal of him, as it was
my habit, at his request, to call on him each morning at his
house in Westbourne Park, to talk over with him matters connected
with the Freehold Land Movement, in which he took, as in
everything that increased human progress, the deepest
interest.&nbsp; As he once remarked half the money spent in gin
would give the people the entire county representation, and
besides provide them with desirable investments against a rainy
day.&nbsp; Mr. James Taylor was always cheered as he showed his
hearers how a man who drank a quart of ale a day engulfed at the
same time a yard of solid earth.&nbsp; Land at that time was to
be had remarkably cheap, and great profits were made by the early
investors, and the moral benefit was great.&nbsp; Men learned the
value of economy and thrift, and were all the better for gaining
habits of forethought and self-denial.&nbsp; In our days the
societies have become chiefly building societies, the political
need of getting a vote in that way not being of so much
importance as it was then.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Victorian era the workman had no
inducement to save, and he spent his money foolishly because he
had no opportunity of spending it better.&nbsp; The Poor-laws as
they were till they were reformed by the Whigs&mdash;a heroic
reform which made them <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>everywhere
unpopular&mdash;actually offered a premium on immorality, and the
woman who had a number of illegitimate children&mdash;the parish
rewarding her according to their number&mdash;was quite a prize
in the matrimonial market.&nbsp; The old Poor-law administration
became the demoralising agency to such an extent for the
manufacture of paupers that honest wage-earners were at a
discount, while numbers of the rate-paying classes found their
lot so intolerable that they elected to swell the pauper ranks,
and thereby much increased their pecuniary, if not their social,
condition.&nbsp; The earlier a labourer became a married man and
the father of a family the better off he became and the more he
got out of his parish.&nbsp; We can scarcely credit it, yet it is
an undoubted fact that under the old Poor-law, if a labourer was
known to be thrifty or putting away his savings, he was refused
work till his money was gone and he was reduced to his proper
level.&nbsp; Even the labourer usually at work received parish
pay for at least four children, and if he worked on the roads
instead of the fields he received out of the highway rates a
pound a-week instead of the usual nine shillings.&nbsp; If a
working man joined a benefit club it generally met in a
public-house, and a certain proportion of the funds were spent in
refreshments&mdash;rather for the benefit of the landlords than
for that of the members.&nbsp; It was not till 1834 that a
reformed <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Poor-law made the practice of thrift
possible.&nbsp; In many quarters law and custom have combined to
prevent its growth among rural labourers who had been taught to
live on the rates&mdash;to extract as much permanent relief as
they could out of a nearly bankrupt body of ratepayers and to do
in return as little hard work as was possible.&nbsp; The
condition of things was then completely changed.&nbsp; The
industrious man had a little better chance, and the idlers were
put to the rout and, much to their disgust, forced to work, or at
any rate to attempt to do so.&nbsp; Even the best benefit
societies remained under a cloud and, till Parliament later on
took the matter in hand, worked under great disadvantages.&nbsp;
Frauds were committed; funds were made away with, and no redress
could be obtained.&nbsp; Thrifty habits were discouraged on every
side.</p>
<p>All England is ringing with the praise of thrift.&nbsp; Not
Scotland, for a Scotchman is born thrifty&mdash;just as he is
said to be born not able to understand a joke.&nbsp; And as to
Irishmen, it is to be questioned whether they have such a word in
their dictionary at all.&nbsp; No class of mutual thrift
institution has flourished there, says the latest writer on the
subject, Rev. Francis Wilkinson; and mostly our earlier thrift
societies were started by a landlord for his own benefit, rather
than for that of the members.&nbsp; Those were drinking days,
says Mr. <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Wilkinson.&nbsp; The public-house
was not only the home, but the cause of their existence; and as
an evidence of the value of benefit clubs to the publican, we
find the establishment of such advertised as one of the assets
when the house is put up for sale.&nbsp; Then there was the
competition of rival houses.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Blue Boar&rdquo;
must have its &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;Black
Lion&rdquo; over the way; and thus the number of clubs, as well
as of public-houses, increased beyond the requirements of the
village or parish, and deterioration was the natural result; and
this was the humorous way in which the past generation acquired
the habit of thrift, of which nowadays we hear so much.</p>
<p>It is very hard to be thrifty.&nbsp; He who would become so
has to fight against tremendous odds.&nbsp; Let me illustrate my
case by my own unpleasant experiences.&nbsp; I had a friend who
was a mining broker.&nbsp; One day I had been studying the late
Captain Burton&rsquo;s valuable work on Brazil, which seemed to
me a country of boundless resources and possibilities.&nbsp; The
next day when I got into the train to go to town, there was my
friend the broker.&nbsp; I talked with him about Brazil in a
rather enthusiastic strain.&nbsp; He agreed with everything I
said.&nbsp; There was no such place in the world, and I could not
do better than buy a few General Brazilian shares.&nbsp; They
were low just at that time, but if I were to buy some I should be
<!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>certain to make ten shillings a share in a month, at
any rate, and by a fortunate coincidence he had a few hundreds he
had bought for an investment, and as a friend he would let me
have a few.&nbsp; I am not a speculating man.&nbsp; The fact is I
have never had any cash to spare; but was tempted, as our Mother
Eve was by the old serpent, and I fell.&nbsp; I bought a few
General Brazilians.&nbsp; As soon as I had paid for them there
came a call for a shilling a share, and a little while after
another call, and so it went on till the General Brazilians went
down to nothing.&nbsp; Shortly after this my friend left the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; He had got all his acquaintances to invest
in shares, and the neighbourhood was getting unpleasant for
him.&nbsp; He began life in a humble way; he now lives in a fine
place and keeps his carriage, but he gets no more money out of
me, though occasionally he did send me a circular assuring me of
an ample fortune if I would only buy certain shares which he
recommended.&nbsp; I may have stood in my own light, as he told
me I did, but I have bought no more mining shares since.</p>
<p>Again, take the case of life assurance.&nbsp; Every one ought
to insure his life when he marries.&nbsp; Like a wise man, I did,
but like a fool I took the advice of a friend who recommended me
a society which paid him a commission for his disinterested and
friendly advice.&nbsp; After a time it declared a bonus which,
instead of receiving <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>in cash, I thought it better to add
to the principal.&nbsp; In a few years, that insurance society
was wound up.&nbsp; After the affairs of the company had been
carefully investigated at an enormous and surely unnecessary
expense by a distinguished firm of City accountants, another
company took over our policies, marking them about a fourth of
their original value.&nbsp; My bonus was not even added to my
principal; and now, being too old to go anew into a life
assurance company, a paltry sum is all I can look forward to to
leave my family on my decease.&nbsp; It is really very ludicrous
the little games played by some of these insurance
companies.&nbsp; It is not every one who raises the cry of thrift
who is anxious to promote that saving virtue.&nbsp; It is too
often the case that even the professed philanthropist, feeling
how true it is that charity begins at home, never troubles
himself to let it go any further.&nbsp; We have Scriptural
authority for saying that one who neglects to provide for his own
house has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.&nbsp;
We are abundantly justified, then, in looking after the
cash.&nbsp; A great philosopher remarked that there are times
when a man without money in his pocket may find himself in a
peculiarly unpleasant position.&nbsp; It was, I think, Hazlitt
who said it, and he was right.&nbsp; Be that as it may, it is a
melancholy truth many of us have learned by experience.&nbsp; I
can send <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>to gaol the poor wretch who in the
street picks my pocket, but the company promoter who offers me a
premium for thrift, and then robs me of my all, or as much of it
as he can lay hold of, gets off scot free.&nbsp; Friendly
societies, as they are called, are on this account often to be
much suspected.&nbsp; The story of one that smashed up is
interesting and amusing.&nbsp; The chief promoter early in life
displayed his abilities as a rogue.&nbsp; He became a
letter-carrier, only to lose his situation and undergo a severe
term of imprisonment for stealing letters.&nbsp; Subsequently, he
entered the service of an Assurance Company, but had eventually
to be dismissed.&nbsp; Then he got a new character, and started
afresh as a Methodist preacher.&nbsp; Afterwards he founded a
friendly society, by means of which he raised large funds for the
benefit of himself, and apparently no one else.</p>
<p>Let me give another case out of my own personal
experience.&nbsp; Last year I received a prospectus of a company
that was formed to purchase the business of a firm which had an
immense number of shops engaged in carrying on a business in
various parts of the metropolis.&nbsp; A firm of accountants
reported that the gross returns of the firm in 1894 amounted to
over &pound;103,000, and it was added that the profit of the
company would admit of annual dividends at the rate of nine per
cent., and allow of &pound;1,300 for the expenses of management
and <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>reserve.&nbsp; It was further shown
that a considerable saving of expenditure could be effected,
which would ensure an additional dividend of three per
cent.&nbsp; Well, the thing looked so feasible that I wrote for
and obtained five shares, thinking I had done a sensible
thing.&nbsp; A few months afterward a West-end firm offered me a
large number of shares at par, stating that the company were
about to pay a dividend, and that the profit on the year&rsquo;s
earnings would be some fifty per cent.&nbsp; However, I did not
accept the promising offer, and I thought no more of the
matter.&nbsp; In January of this year a gentleman sent me a
circular offering me shares at a shilling under par, assuring me
that the company was about to pay a dividend of ten per cent. in
the course of the next week.&nbsp; Again I declined to increase
my holding, and it is well I did, as no dividend has been paid,
although the circular stated that the business was of &ldquo;a
most profitable nature,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sure to considerably
increase in value in the course of a few months.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Since then a Manchester firm has twice written to me to offer the
pound shares at sixteen shillings each.&nbsp; These tempting
offers I have declined, and the promised dividend seems as far
off as ever.&nbsp; Surely outside brokers who put forward such
lying statements ought to be amenable to law, as well as the
promoters of the company itself.&nbsp; To my great disgust, since
the above was <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>written I have received another
letter from another outside firm, offering me fifty shares in the
precious company at thirteen shillings a share.&nbsp; The writers
add, as the dividend of ten per cent. will be paid almost
immediately, they are well worth my attention.&nbsp; I suppose
this sort of thing pays.&nbsp; The worst of it is that the class
thus victimised are the class least able to bear a pecuniary
loss.&nbsp; I happen to know of a case in which a man with an
assumed name, trading at the West End, gained a large sum of
money&mdash;chiefly from clergymen and widows&mdash;by offering
worthless shares, certain to pay large dividends in a week or
two, at a tremendous sacrifice.&nbsp; As a rule the victims to
this state of things say nothing of their losses.&nbsp; They are
ashamed when they think how easily they have been persuaded to
part with their cash.&nbsp; It is time, however, that public
attention should be called to the matter, that the eyes of the
public were opened, and that the game of these gentry were be

<span class="smcap">The Old London Pulpit</span>.</h2>
<p>I doubt whether the cynical old poet who wrote &ldquo;The
Pleasures of Memory,&rdquo; would have included in that category
the recollections of the famous preachers whom he might have
heard.&nbsp; Yet possibly he might, as his earliest
predilections, we were told, were for the pulpit, and all have,
more or less, of the parsonic element in them.&nbsp; The love to
lecture, the desire to make their poor ignorant friends as
sensible as themselves, the innate feeling that one is a light
and guide in a wildering maze exist more or less in us all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you ever hear me preach?&rdquo; said Coleridge one day
to Lamb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I ever hear you do anything
else?&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; And now, when we have got an
awakened Christianity and a forward ministry, it is just as well
to run over the list of our old popular ministers to remind the
present generation that great men have filled the London pulpits
and quickened the London conscience and aroused the London
intellect before ever it was born.&nbsp; It is the more necessary
to do this as the fact is that no one has so short-lived a
popularity as <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>the orator: whether in Exeter Hall,
whether on the stage, whether in the pulpit, what comes in at one
ear soon goes out at the other.&nbsp; The memory of a great
preacher dies as soon as his breath leaves the body&mdash;often
before.&nbsp; The pulpit of to-day differs in one respect <i>in
toto</i> from the past.&nbsp; The preacher who would succeed now
must remember that this is the age of advertisement, that if he
has a talent he must not wrap it in a napkin.&nbsp; He must write
letters to newspapers; he must say odd things that make men talk
about him; he must manage to be the subject of newspaper gossip;
he must cling to the skirts of some public agitation&mdash;in
fact, his light must be seen and his voice heard everywhere.</p>
<p>It was not so in the times when, half a century ago, I had
more to do with the London pulpit than I have now.&nbsp; Some of
the men in it were giants.&nbsp; One was Melville, who preached
somewhere over the water&mdash;Camberwell way.&nbsp; He was a
High Churchman; he had a grand scorn of the conventicle.&nbsp; I
should say he was a Tory of the Tories&mdash;a man who would be
impossible in a London suburban church now; but what a crowd he
drew to hear him, as he, like a mighty, rushing wind, swept over
the heads of an audience who seemed to hang upon his lips!&nbsp;
He was tall, dark, with a magnificent bass voice that caused
every sentence he read&mdash;for he read, and rapidly&mdash;to
vibrate from the <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>pulpit to the furthest corner of the
church.&nbsp; His style was that of the late Dr. Chalmers, always
sweeping to a climax, which, when reached and mastered, was a
relief to all.&nbsp; I think he was made Canon of St.
Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He also was the Golden Lecturer somewhere
near the Bank&mdash;an appropriate locality.&nbsp; His sermons
were highly finished&mdash;I am told he laboured at them all the
week.&nbsp; He was a preacher&mdash;nothing less, nothing
more.</p>
<p>Next there rises before me the vision of Howard Hinton&mdash;a
big, cadaverous, grey-haired man, preaching in a small chapel on
the site in Shoreditch now occupied by the Great Eastern
Railway.&nbsp; The congregation was not large, but it was very
select; I fancy it represented the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the
London Baptists.&nbsp; He was a very fascinating preacher by
reason of his great subtlety of thought, and at times he was
terribly impressive, as his big, burly frame trembled with
emotion, and his choked-up utterance intimated with what agony he
had sought to deliver his soul from blood-guiltiness, as, wailing
and weeping, he anticipated the awful doom of the
impenitent.&nbsp; I must own I got wearied of his metaphysical
subtleties, which seemed to promise so much, and whose
conclusions were so lame and impotent, ever disappointing; and it
often seemed to me that his celebrated son&mdash;the late James
Hinton&mdash;too soon removed, as it seemed to many of
us&mdash;inherited not a little of <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>his
father&rsquo;s ingenuity in this respect.&nbsp; But he was a
grand man; you felt it in his presence, and still more as you
walked home thinking of what he said.</p>
<p>Amongst the Independents&mdash;as they were termed&mdash;the
leading men were the Brothers Clayton: one preaching at the
Poultry, the other in Walworth, to large congregations&mdash;fine
portly men, and able in their way, though it was an old-fashioned
one.&nbsp; Nor must Dr. Bengo Collyer be forgotten&mdash;a fat,
oily man of God, as Robert Hall called him, who had at one time
great popularity, and whom the Duke of Kent had been to hear
preach.</p>
<p>It is a curious sign of the times&mdash;the contrast between
what exists now and what existed then&mdash;as regards
theological speculation.&nbsp; We are now sublimely indifferent
whether a preacher is orthodox or the reverse, whatever that may
mean, so long as we feel his utterances are helpful in the way of
Christian work and life.&nbsp; It was not so fifty years
ago.&nbsp; Ministers scanned their brethren in the ministry
severely, and the deacon, with his Matthew Henry and Doddridge,
sat grimly in his pew, eager to note the deflection of the
preacher in the pulpit from the strait and narrow line of
orthodoxy, and to glow with unholy zeal as he found him missing
his footing on the tight-rope.&nbsp; In London there was such a
man in the shape of Thomas Binney, who had come from the Isle of
Wight to the <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>King&rsquo;s Weigh House Chapel, now
swept away by the underground railway just opposite the
Monument.&nbsp; Binney was a king among men, standing head and
shoulders above his fellows.&nbsp; All that was intelligent in
Dissenting London, among the young men especially, heard him
gladly.&nbsp; Yet all over the land there were soulless deacons
and crabbed old parsons, whose testimony no man regarded, who
said Binney was not orthodox.&nbsp; He lived long enough to
trample that charge down.&nbsp; He lived to see the new era when
men, sick of orthodoxy, hailed any utterance from whatever
quarter, so that it were God-fearing and sincere.&nbsp; As you
listened to Binney struggling to evolve his message out of his
inner consciousness, you felt that you stood in the presence of a
man who dwelt in the Divine presence, to whom God had revealed
Himself, whose eye could detect the sham, and whose hot
indignation was terrible to listen to.</p>
<p>Let me chronicle a few more names.&nbsp; Dr. Andrew Reed,
whose occasional sermons at other places&mdash;I never heard him
at Wycliffe Chapel&mdash;were most effective; Morris of Fetter
Lane, who preached to a crowded audience with what seemed to me
at the time a slight touch of German mysticism; Stratten, far
away in Paddington, whom rich people loved to listen to, as he
was supposed to be a man of means himself; and old Leifchild at
Craven Chapel, filled to overflowing with a crowd who <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>knew, however the dear old man might prose in the
opening of his sermon, he would go off with a bang at the
end.&nbsp; But I may not omit two Churchmen who, if they had not
Melville&rsquo;s power, had an equal popularity.&nbsp; One was
the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel, who preached in a church, long
since pulled down, in Bedford-row.&nbsp; He was tall,
gentlemanly, silver-tongued, and perfectly orthodox.&nbsp; His
people worshipped him, for was he not the son of a lord?&nbsp;
His influence in London was immense, but he left the Church for
conscientious reasons, and became a Baptist minister.&nbsp; That
was a blow to his popularity which he never got over, though he
lived to a grand old age.&nbsp; Another popular Evangelical
preacher was Dale, who preached at St. Bride&rsquo;s, Fleet
Street.&nbsp; He was a poet and more or less of a literary man;
but he had more worldly wisdom than Baptist Noel.&nbsp; Dale was
a Professor of Literature at University College; but it was
understood that University College, with its liberal
institutions, with its Dissenters and Jews, was no place for a
Churchman who wished to rise.&nbsp; Dale saw this, gave up his
professorship in Gower Street, and reaped a rich reward.</p>
<p>London was badly off for <i>illuminati</i> fifty years
ago.&nbsp; The only pulpit effectually filled was that of South
Place, Finsbury, where W. Johnson Fox, the celebrated orator and
critic, <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>lectured.&nbsp; He had been trained
to be an orthodox divine at Homerton.&nbsp; One day he said to
me, &ldquo;The students always get very orthodox as they get to
the end of their collegiate career, and are preparing to settle,
as the phrase is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fox, it seems, was the exception
that proves the rule.&nbsp; He was eloquent and attractive as
preacher and lecturer.&nbsp; Dickens and Macready and Foster
were, I believe, among his hearers.&nbsp; At any rate, he had a
large following, and died an M.P.&nbsp; Lectures on all things
sacred and profane were unknown in London fifty years ago.&nbsp;
I once heard Robert Dale Owen somewhere at the back of Tottenham
Court Road Chapel, but he was a weariness of the flesh, and I
never went near him again.&nbsp; The provinces occasionally sent
us popular orators; one was Raffles, of Liverpool, a man who
looked as if the world had used him well.&nbsp; I well remember
how he dealt in such alliteration as &ldquo;the dewdrop
glittering in the glen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then there was Parsons of
York, with his amazing rhetoric, all whispered with a thrill that
went to every heart, as he preached in Surrey Chapel, where also
I heard Jay of Bath, who, however, left on me no impression other
than he was a wonderful old man for his years.&nbsp; Sherman, the
regular preacher there, was a great favourite with the
ladies&mdash;almost as much as Dr. Cumming, a dark,
scholarly-looking man, who held forth in a court just opposite
Drury <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Lane Theatre, and whose prophetic
utterances obtained for him a popularity he would otherwise have
sought in vain.&nbsp; It makes one feel old to write of these
good men who have long since passed away, not, however,
unregretted, or without failing to leave behind them</p>
<blockquote><p>Footprints on the sands of Time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first became familiar with the Dissenting world of
London the most bustling man in it was the Rev. Dr. John
Campbell, who preached in what was then a most melancholy pile of
buildings known as the Tottenham Court Road Chapel, the pulpit of
which had been at one time occupied by the celebrated George
Whitfield.&nbsp; In or about 1831 Dr. Campbell became the
minister, and at the same time found leisure to write in <i>The
Patriot</i> newspaper; to fight and beat the trustees of the
Tottenham Court Road, who had allowed the affairs of the chapel
to get into a most disorderly state; to make speeches at public
meetings; to write in a monthly that has long ceased to
exist&mdash;<i>The Eclectic Review</i>&mdash;a review to which I
had occasionally the honour of contributing when it was edited by
Dr. Price;&mdash;and to publish a good many books which had a
fair sale in his day.&nbsp; Dr. Campbell had also much to do with
the abolition of the Bible printing monopoly&mdash;a movement
originated by Dr. Adam Thomson, of Coldstream, <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>powerfully
supported by one of my earliest friends, Mr. John Childs, a
spirited and successful printer at Bungay, whose one-volume
editions of standard authors, such as Bacon&rsquo;s works,
Milton&rsquo;s, and Gibbon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Decline and Pall of the
Roman Empire,&rdquo; are still to be seen on the shelves of
second-hand booksellers.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s Printer affected
to believe that the Bible could not be supplied to the public
with equal efficiency or cheapness on any other system than that
which gave him the monopoly of printing, but as it was proved
before a Committee of the House of Commons that the Book could be
printed at much less cost and in every way equal to the copies
then in existence, the monopoly was destroyed.</p>
<p>In 1830 there came into existence the Congregational Union of
England and Wales, of which Dr. Campbell became one of the
leading men.&nbsp; He was at the same time editor of <i>The
Christian Witness</i> and <i>The Christian&rsquo;s Penny
Magazine</i>&mdash;the organs of the Union&mdash;both of which at
that time secured what was then considered a very enormous
sale.&nbsp; When in 1835 Mr. Nasmith came to London to establish
his City Mission Dr. Campbell was one of his earliest supporters
and friends.&nbsp; The next great work which he took in hand was
the establishment of <i>The British Banner</i>, a religious paper
for the masses, in answer to an appeal made to him by the
committee of <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span><i>The Patriot</i> newspaper.&nbsp;
The first number of the new journal appeared in 1848, and gained
a circulation hitherto unknown in a weekly paper, and this in
time was succeeded by <i>The British Standard</i>.&nbsp; As time
passed on Dr. Campbell became less popular.&nbsp; He had rather
too keen a scent for what was termed neology.&nbsp; In one case
his zeal involved him in a libel suit and the verdict was for the
plaintiff, who was awarded by the jury forty shillings damages
instead of the &pound;5,000 he had claimed.&nbsp; In the Rivulet
Controversy, as it was termed, Dr. Campbell was not quite so
successful.&nbsp; Mr. Lynch was a poet, and preached, as his
health was bad, to a small but select congregation in the
Hampstead Road.&nbsp; He published a volume of refined and
thoughtful poetry which has many admirers to this day.&nbsp; The
late Mr. James Grant&mdash;a Scotch baker who had taken to
literature and written several remarkably trashy books, the most
popular of which was &ldquo;Random Recollections of the House of
Commons,&rdquo;&mdash;at that time editor of the publican&rsquo;s
paper, <i>The Morning Advertiser</i>, in his paper described the
work of Mr. Lynch as calculated to inspire pain and sadness in
the minds of all who knew what real religion was.&nbsp; Against
this view a powerful protest was made by many leading men of the
body to which Mr. Lynch belonged.&nbsp; At this stage of the
controversy Dr. Campbell struck in by publishing letters
addressed to the principal <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>professors
of the Independent and Baptist colleges of England, showing that
the hymns of Mr. Lynch were very defective as regards Evangelical
truth&mdash;containing less of it than the hymns ordinarily sung
by the Unitarians.&nbsp; The excitement in Dissenting circles was
intense.&nbsp; The celebrated Thomas Binney, of the King&rsquo;s
Weigh House Chapel, took part with Mr. Lynch and complained of
Dr. Campbell in the ensuing meetings of the Congregational Union,
and so strong was the feeling on the subject that a large party
was formed to request the Congregational Union formally to sever
their official connexion with Dr. Campbell&mdash;a matter not
quite so easy as had been anticipated.&nbsp; One result, however,
was that Dr. Campbell gave up the editing of <i>The British
Banner</i> and established <i>The British Standard</i> to take
its place, in which the warfare against what is called Neology
was carried on with accelerated zeal.&nbsp; In 1867 the
Doctor&rsquo;s laborious career came to an end happily in comfort
and at peace with all.&nbsp; His biographers assure the reader
that Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s works will last till the final
conflagration of the world.&nbsp; Alas! no one reads them
now.</p>
<p>To come to later times, of course my most vivid recollections
are those connected with the late Mr. Spurgeon.&nbsp; In that
region of the metropolis known as &ldquo;over the water&rdquo;
the Baptists flourish as they do nowhere else, and <!-- page
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>some of their chapels have an interesting
history.&nbsp; Amongst many of them rather what is called high
doctrine is tolerated&mdash;not to say admired.&nbsp; They are
the elect of God, preordained before the world was formed to
enjoy an existence of beatific rapture, that shall continue when
the world has passed away.&nbsp; Of one of the most popular
preachers in that locality, the late Jemmy Wells, it is said that
when told that one of his hearers had fallen out of a cart and
broken his leg his reply was, &ldquo;Oh, what a blessed thing it
is he can&rsquo;t fall out of the Covenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; When one
of the chapels in that locality was at low-water mark, there came
to it the Rev. Charles Haddon Spurgeon&mdash;then little more
than a boy, but already famous in East Anglia as a boy
preacher&mdash;and never had a preacher a more successful
career.&nbsp; There was no place in London that was large enough
to contain the audiences that flocked to hear him.&nbsp; I first
heard him at the Surrey Music Hall, and it was wonderful to see
what hordes came there of saints and sinners, lords and ladies,
City magnates and county squires, Anonymas from St. John&rsquo;s
Wood, Lady Clara Vere de Veres from Belgravia.&nbsp; It was the
fashion to go there on a Sunday morning, just as it was the
fashion a generation previously to rush to Hatton Garden to hear
Edward Irving.&nbsp; The hall was handsome and light and airy,
free from the somewhat oppressive <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>air of Cave
Adullam and Little Bethel, and there upon the platform which did
duty for a pulpit stood a young man short of stature, broadly
built, of a genial though not handsome countenance, with a big
head and a voice it was a treat to listen to and audible in every
part of that enormous building.&nbsp; What was the secret of his
success?&nbsp; He was bold, he was original, he was humorous, and
he was in earnest.&nbsp; He said things to make his hearers
laugh, and what he said or did was magnified by rumour.&nbsp; Old
stories of Billy Dawson and Rowland Hill were placed to Mr.
Spurgeon&rsquo;s credit.&nbsp; The caricaturists made him their
butt.&nbsp; There was no picture more commonly displayed at that
time than one entitled &ldquo;Brimstone and
Treacle&rdquo;&mdash;the former representing Mr. Spurgeon, the
latter Mr. Bellew, then a star of the first order in many an
Episcopalian pulpit.&nbsp; Bellew soon ran through his ephemeral
popularity&mdash;that of Mr. Spurgeon grew and strengthened day
by day.&nbsp; Do you, like the late Sir James Graham, want to
know the reason why?&nbsp; The answer is soon given.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am going into the ministry,&rdquo; said a youthful
student to an old divine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, but, my dear friend,
is the ministry in you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, the ministry was in
Mr. Spurgeon as it rarely is in any man; hence his unparalleled
success.</p>
<p>One little anecdote will illustrate this.&nbsp; I have a
friend whose father had a large business <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>in the
ancient city of Colchester.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s father was
at one time in his employ.&nbsp; Naturally, he said a good deal
of the preaching talent of his gifted son, and of the intention
beginning to be entertained in the family circle of making a
minister of him.&nbsp; The employer in question was a Churchman,
but he himself offered to help Mr. Spurgeon in securing for his
son the benefits of a collegiate education.&nbsp; The son&rsquo;s
reply was characteristic.&nbsp; He declined the offered aid,
adding the remark that &ldquo;ministers were made not in colleges
but in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s scholastic career let
me knock a little fiction on the head.&nbsp; There is a house in
Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, famous now as the birthplace of Mrs.
Garrett Anderson and her gifted sisters, which at one time was a
school kept by a Mr. Swindell, and they told me at Aldeburgh this
last summer that Mr. Spurgeon was a pupil there.&nbsp; This is
not so.&nbsp; It is true Mr. Spurgeon was a pupil at Mr.
Swindell&rsquo;s, but it was at Newmarket, to which the latter
had moved from Aldeburgh.</p>
<p>One or two Spurgeon anecdotes which have not yet appeared in
print may be acceptable.&nbsp; At Hastings there are, or were,
many High Church curates.&nbsp; A few years ago one of them did a
very sensible thing.&nbsp; He had a holiday; he was in town and
he went to the Tabernacle, getting a seat exactly under Mr.
Spurgeon&rsquo;s nose, as it were.&nbsp; It seems that during the
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>week Mr. Spurgeon had been attending a High Church
service, of which he gave in the pulpit a somewhat ludicrous
account, suddenly finishing by giving a sort of snort, and
exclaiming, &ldquo;Methinks I smell &rsquo;em now,&rdquo; much to
the delight of the curate sitting underneath.&nbsp; Referring to
Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s nose, I am told he had a great admiration of
that of his brother, a much more aristocratic-looking article
that his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; he is reported to have
said on one occasion, &ldquo;I wish I had got your
nose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I
wish I had got your cheek.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me give another
story.&nbsp; On one occasion an artist wanted to make a sketch of
Mr. Spurgeon for publishing.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you going to
charge?&rdquo; asked the preacher, as the artist appeared before
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must not make the price more than twopence;
the public will give that for me&mdash;not a penny more.&nbsp; A
photographer published a portrait of me at eighteenpence, and no
one bought it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This conversation took place on the
occasion of a week-night service.&nbsp; At the close of the
service the artist came up into the vestry to show his
sketch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Spurgeon, &ldquo;it is
all very well, but I should like to hear what others say about
it.&nbsp; They say women and fools are the best judges of this
kind of thing,&rdquo; and accordingly the likeness was referred
to a friend who happened to come into the room in the nick of
time.</p>
<p><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>It always seemed to me the great characteristic of Mr.
Spurgeon was good-natured jollity.&nbsp; He was as full of fun as
a boy.&nbsp; I saw him once before getting into a wagonette pitch
all the rugs on his brother&rsquo;s head, who naturally returned
the compliment&mdash;much to the amusement of the
spectators.&nbsp; On one occasion I happened to be in the
Tabernacle when the Baptist Union dined there, as it always did
at the time of the Baptist anniversaries.&nbsp; I suppose there
would be many hundreds present who enjoyed the ample repast and
the accompanying claret and sherry.&nbsp; After the dinner was
over Mr. Spurgeon came up to where I was sitting and, laying his
hand on my shoulder and pointing to the long rows of empty
bottles left standing on the table, with a twinkle in his eye,
said, &ldquo;Teetotalism does not seem to flourish among the
brethren, does it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he was as kind as he was
cheerful.&nbsp; Once and once only I had to write to him.&nbsp;
He returned me a reply addressed to me in my proper name, and
then&mdash;as I was writing weekly articles under a <i>nom de
plume</i> in a highly popular journal&mdash;added, in a
postscript, &ldquo;Kind regards to &mdash;&rdquo; (mentioning my
<i>nom de plume</i>).&nbsp; The anecdote is trivial, but it shows
how genial and kind-hearted he was.</p>
<p>And to the last what crowds attended his ministry at the
Tabernacle!&nbsp; One Saturday I went to dine with a friend
living on Clapham <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Common.&nbsp; Going back to town
early in the morning I got into an omnibus, and was amused by
hearing the conductor exclaim, &ldquo;Any more for the
Tabernacle!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, then, for the
Tabernacle!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This way for the
Tabernacle!&rdquo; and, sure enough, I found all my
fellow-passengers got out when we arrived at the Tabernacle; nor
was the &rsquo;bus in which I was riding the only one thus
utilised.&nbsp; There was no end of omnibuses from all quarters
drawing up at the entrance.&nbsp; According to the latest
utterance of Mr. Herbert Beerbohm Tree, in this age of ours faith
is tinged with philosophic doubt, love is regarded as but a spasm
of the nervous system, life itself as the refrain of a music-hall
song.&nbsp; At the Tabernacle the pastor and people were of a
very different way of thinking.</p>
<p>And Mr. Spurgeon was no windbag&mdash;<i>vox et pr&aelig;terea
nihil</i>; no darling pet of old women whose Christianity was
flabby as an oyster.&nbsp; He was an incessant worker, and taught
his people to work as well in his enormous church.&nbsp; Such was
the orderly arrangement that, as he said, if one of his people
were to get tipsy, he should know it before the week was
out.&nbsp; He never seemed to lose a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whenever I have been permitted,&rdquo; he wrote on one
occasion, &ldquo;sufficient respite from my ministerial duties to
enjoy a lengthened tour or even a short excursion, I have been in
the habit of carrying with me a small note-book, in which I have
<!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>jotted down any illustrations that occurred to me on
the way.&nbsp; The note-book has been useful in my travels as a
mental purse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the note-book was not
intrusive.&nbsp; A friend of mine took Mr. Spurgeon in his steam
yacht up the Highlands.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon was like a boy out of
school&mdash;all the while naming the mountains after his
friends.</p>
<p>It is also to be noted how the public opinion altered with
regard to Mr. Spurgeon.&nbsp; When he came first to London aged
ministers and grey-haired deacons shook their heads.&nbsp; What
could they think of a young minister who could stop in the middle
of his sermon, and say, &ldquo;Please shut that window down,
there is a draught.&nbsp; I like a draught of porter, but not
that kind of draught&rdquo;?&nbsp; It was terrible!&nbsp; What
next? was asked in fear and trepidation.&nbsp; These things were,
I believe, often said on purpose, and they answered their
purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire low,&rdquo; said a general to his men
on one occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire low,&rdquo; said old Jay, of
Bath, as he was preaching to a class of students.&nbsp; Mr.
Spurgeon fired low.&nbsp; It is astonishing how that kind of
preaching tells.&nbsp; I was travelling in Essex last summer, and
in the train were two old men, one of whom lived in Kelvedon,
where Mr. Spurgeon was born, who had sent the Baptist preacher
some fruit from Kelvedon, which was, as he expected, thankfully
received.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you see what Mr. Spurgeon says in this
week&rsquo;s <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>sermon?&rdquo; said he to the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, he said the
devil said to him the other day, &lsquo;Mr. Spurgeon, you have
got a good many faults,&rsquo; and I said to the devil, &lsquo;So
have you,&rsquo;&rdquo; and then the old saints burst out
laughing as if the repartee was as brilliant as it seemed to me
the reverse; but I leave censure to the censorious.&nbsp; In his
early youth, Sadi, the great Persian classic, tells us, he was
over much religious, and found fault with the company sleeping
while he sat in attendance on his father with the Koran in his
lap, never closing his eyes all night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, emanation
of your father,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;you had better
also have slept than that you should thus calumniate the failings
of mankind.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">Memories of Exeter Hall</span>.</h2>
<p>As the season of the May Meetings draws near, one naturally
thinks of Exeter Hall and its interesting associations.&nbsp;
When I first came to London it had not long been open, and it was
a wonder to the young man from the country to see its capacious
interior and its immense platform crowded in every part.&nbsp; It
had a much less gorgeous interior than now, but its capacities
for stowing away a large audience still remains the same; and
then, as now, it was available alike for Churchmen and Dissenters
to plead the claims of the great religious societies, but it
seems to me that the audiences were larger and more enthusiastic
at that early date, though I know not that the oratory was
better.&nbsp; Bishops on the platform were rare, and the
principal performer in that line was Bishop Stanley, of Norwich,
a grotesque-looking little man, but not so famous as his
distinguished son, the Dean of Westminster.&nbsp; Leading
Evangelical ministers from the country&mdash;such as James, of
Birmingham, who had a very pathetic voice, and Hugh McNeile, of
Liverpool, <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>an Irishman, with all an
Irishman&rsquo;s exuberance of gesture and of language&mdash;were
a great feature.&nbsp; At times the crowds were so great that a
meeting had to be improvised in the Lower Hall, then a much
darker hall than it is now, but which, at any rate, answered its
end for the time being.&nbsp; The missionary meetings were the
chief attraction.&nbsp; Proceedings commenced early, and were
protracted far into the afternoon; but the audience remained to
the last, the ladies knitting assiduously all the while the
report was being read, and only leaving off to listen when the
speaking began.&nbsp; Perhaps the most crowded meeting ever held
there&mdash;at any rate, in my time&mdash;was when Prince Albert
took the chair to inaugurate Sir Fowell Buxton&rsquo;s grand, but
unfortunate, scheme for the opening up of the Congo.&nbsp; He
spoke in a low tone, and with a somewhat foreign accent.&nbsp;
Bishop Wilberforce&rsquo;s oratory on that occasion was
overpowering; the Prince&rsquo;s eyes were rivetted on him all
the while.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel spoke in a calm, dignified,
statesmanlike manner, but the expression of his face was too
supercilious to be pleasing.&nbsp; And there was Daniel
O&rsquo;Connell&mdash;big, burly, rollicking&mdash;who seemed to
enjoy the triumph of his own presence, though not permitted to
speak.&nbsp; The other time when I remember an awful crush at
Exeter Hall was at an anti-slavery meeting, when Lord Brougham
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>took the chair; an M.P. dared to attack his lordship,
and his reply was crushing, his long nose twitching all the while
with a passion he was unable to repress.&nbsp; He looked as angry
as he felt.&nbsp; Amongst the missionaries, the most popular
speakers were John Williams, the martyr of Erromanga, and William
Knibb, the famous Baptist missionary from Jamaica, and
Livingstone&rsquo;s father-in-law, the venerable Dr. Moffat, who,
once upon his legs, seemed as if he could never sit down
again.&nbsp; Williams was a heavy man in appearance, but of such
evident goodness and earnestness that you were interested in what
he said nevertheless.&nbsp; William Knibb was, as far as
appearance went, quite the reverse; a fiery speaker, the very
picture of a demagogue, the champion of the slave, and a terrible
thorn in the sides of the slave-owners.&nbsp; Of women orators we
had none in those primitive times, and some of the American women
who had come to speak at one or other of the Anti-Slavery
Conventions&mdash;at that time of constant occurrence&mdash;were
deeply disappointed that, after coming all the way from America
on purpose to deliver their testimony, they were not allowed to
open their mouths.&nbsp; It was at Exeter Hall that I first heard
Mr. Gough, the Temperance advocate&mdash;an actor more than an
orator, but of wonderful power.</p>
<p>It was at Crosby Hall that I first heard George Dawson.&nbsp;
I think it was at one of the <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>meetings
held there in connection with what I may call the anti-Graham,
demonstration.&nbsp; On the introduction, in 1843, by Sir James
Graham of his Factories Education Bill, the Dissenters assailed
it with unexpected vehemence.&nbsp; They denounced it as a scheme
for destroying the educational machinery they had, at great
expense, provided, and for throwing the care of the young into
the hands of the clergy of the Church of England.&nbsp; It was in
the East of London that the opposition to this measure
originated, and a committee was formed, of which Dr. Andrew Reed
was chairman, and his son, afterwards Sir Charles, who lived to
become Chairman of the London School Board, was secretary.&nbsp;
The agitation spread all over the country, and delegates to a
considerable number on one occasion found their way to Crosby
Hall.&nbsp; In the course of the proceedings a young man in the
gallery got up to say that he came from Birmingham to show how
the popular feeling had changed there from the time when
Church-and-State mobs had sacked the Dissenting chapels, and
driven Dr. Priestley into exile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your name,
sir?&rdquo; asked the chairman.&nbsp; &ldquo;George
Dawson,&rdquo; was the reply, and there he stood in the midst of
the grave and reverend seigneurs, calm, youthful, self-possessed,
with his dark hair parted in the middle, a voice somewhat husky
yet clear.&nbsp; He was a Baptist minister, he said, <!-- page
211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>yet he looked as little like one as it was possible to
imagine.</p>
<p>It was a little later, that is, in 1857, Mr. Samuel Morley
made his <i>d&eacute;but</i> in political life, at a meeting in
the London Tavern, of which he was chairman, to secure
responsible administration in every department of the State, to
shut all the back doors which lead to public employment, to throw
the public service open to all England, to obtain recognition of
merit everywhere, and to put an end to all kinds of promotion by
favour or purchase.&nbsp; Mr. Morley&rsquo;s speech was clear and
convincing&mdash;more business-like than oratorical&mdash;and he
never got beyond that.&nbsp; The tide was in his favour&mdash;all
England was roused by the tale <i>The Times</i> told of neglect
and cruel mismanagement in the Crimea.&nbsp; Since then
Government has done less and the people more.&nbsp; Has the
change been one for the better?</p>
<p>One of the most extraordinary meetings in which I ever took a
part was an Orange demonstration in Freemasons&rsquo; Hall, the
Earl of Roden in the chair.&nbsp; I was a student at the time,
and one of my fellow-students was Sir Colman O&rsquo;Loghlen, the
son of the Irish Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; He was a friend of
Dan O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s, and he conceived the idea of getting
all or as many of his fellow-students as possible to go to the
meeting and break it up.&nbsp; We walked accordingly, each one of
us with a <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>good-sized stick in his hand, to the
Free-Mason&rsquo;s Tavern, the mob exclaiming, as we passed
along, &ldquo;There go the Chartists,&rdquo; and perhaps we did
look like them, for none of us were overdressed.&nbsp; In the
hall we took up a conspicuous position, and waited patiently, but
we had not long to wait.&nbsp; As soon as the clergy and leading
Orangemen on the platform had taken their seats, we were ready
for the fray.&nbsp; Apart from us, the audience was not large,
and we had the hall almost entirely to ourselves.&nbsp; Not a
word of the chairman&rsquo;s address was audible.&nbsp; There was
a madman of the name of Captain Acherley who was in the habit, at
that time, of attending public meetings solely for the sake of
disturbing them, who urged us on&mdash;and we were too ready to
be urged on.&nbsp; With our voices and our sticks we managed to
create a hideous row.&nbsp; The meeting had to come to a
premature close, and we marched off, feeling that we had driven
back the enemy, and achieved a triumph.&nbsp; Whether we had done
any good, however, I more than doubt.&nbsp; There were other and
fairer memories, however, in connection with Freemasons&rsquo;
Hall.&nbsp; It was there I beheld the illustrious Clarkson, who
had come in the evening of his life, when his whole frame was
bowed with age, and the grasshopper had become a burden, to
preside at the World&rsquo;s Anti-Slavery Convention.&nbsp; All I
can remember of him was that he had a red face, <!-- page
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>grey hair, and was dressed in black.&nbsp; There, and
at Exeter Hall, Joseph Sturge, the Apostle of Peace, was often to
be seen.&nbsp; He was a well-made man, with a singularly pleasant
cast of countenance and attractive voice, and, as was to be
expected, as cool as a Quaker.&nbsp; Another great man, now
forgotten, was Joseph Buckingham, lecturer, traveller, author,
and orator, M.P. for Sheffield.</p>
<p>In the City the places for demonstrations are fewer now than
they were.&nbsp; The London Tavern I have already
mentioned.&nbsp; Then there was the King&rsquo;s Arms, I think it
was called, in the Poultry, chiefly occupied by Dissenting
societies.&nbsp; At the London Coffee House, at the Ludgate Hill
corner of the Old Bailey, now utilised by Hope Brothers, but
interesting to us as the scene of the birth and childhood of our
great artist, Leech, meetings were occasionally held; and then
there was the Crown and Anchor, in the Strand, on your left, just
before you get to Arundel Street, where Liberals, or, rather,
Whigs, delighted to appeal to the people&mdash;the only source of
legitimate power.&nbsp; It was there that I heard that grand
American orator, Beecher, as he pleaded, amidst resounding
cheers, the cause of the North during the American Civil War, and
the great Temperance orator, Gough, who took Exeter Hall by
storm.&nbsp; But it was to Exeter Hall that the tribes
repaired&mdash;as <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>they do now.&nbsp; When I first knew
Exeter Hall, no one ever dreamt of any other way of regenerating
society.&nbsp; Agnosticism, Secularism, Spiritualism, and
Altruism had not come into existence.&nbsp; Their professors were
weeping and wailing in long clothes.&nbsp; Now we have, indeed,
swept into a younger day, and society makes lions of men of whom
our fathers would have taken no heed.&nbsp; We have become more
tolerant&mdash;even Exeter Hall has moved with the times.&nbsp;
Perhaps one of the boldest things connected with it was the
attempt to utilise it for public religious worship on the
Sunday.&nbsp; Originally some of the Evangelical clergy had
agreed to take part in these services, but the rector of the
parish in which Exeter Hall was situated disapproved, and
consequently they were unable to appear.&nbsp; The result was the
services were conducted by the leading ministers of other
denominations, nor were they less successful on that account.</p>

<span class="smcap">Men I Have Known</span>.</h2>
<p>It is the penalty of old age to lose all our friends and
acquaintances, but fortunately our hold on earth weakens as the
end of life draws near.&nbsp; In an active life, we see much of
the world and the men who help to make it better.&nbsp; Many
ministers and missionaries came to my father&rsquo;s house with
wonderful accounts of the spread of the Gospel in foreign
parts.&nbsp; At a later time I saw a knot of popular lecturers
and agitators&mdash;such as George Thompson, the great
anti-slavery lecturer, who, born in humble life, managed to get
into Parliament, where he collapsed altogether.&nbsp; As an
outdoor orator he was unsurpassed, and carried all before
him.&nbsp; After a speech of his I heard Lord Brougham declare it
was one of the most eloquent he had ever heard.&nbsp; He started
a newspaper, which, however, did not make much way.&nbsp; Then
there was Henry Vincent, another natural orator, whom the common
people heard gladly, and who at one time was very near getting
into Parliament as M.P. for Ipswich, then, as now, a go-ahead
town, full of Dissenters <!-- page 218--><a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>and
Radicals.&nbsp; He began life as a Chartist and printer, and, I
believe, was concerned in the outbreak near Newport.&nbsp; Of the
same class was a man of real genius and immense learning,
considering the disadvantages of his lowly birth, Thomas Cooper,
the Chartist, and author of that magnificent poem, &ldquo;The
Purgatory of Suicides,&rdquo; written when he was in gaol for
being connected with a Chartist outbreak.&nbsp; He had been a
Methodist, he became a Freethinker, and, when I knew him, was
under the influence of Strauss&rsquo;s Life of Jesus, a book
which George Eliot had translated, and which made a great
sensation at the time of its appearance, though it is utterly
forgotten now.&nbsp; Cooper and I were members of an obscure
club, in one of the Fleet Street courts, where he used to declaim
with great eloquence on the evil doings of the Tories and the
wrongs of the poor, while at the same time he had a true
appreciation of the utter worthlessness of some of the Chartist
leaders.&nbsp; As he advanced in years he gave up his infidel
opinions and became an earnest advocate of the faith he once
laboured to destroy.&nbsp; The last time I saw him was at his
house in Lincoln shortly before he died.&nbsp; He seemed sound in
body, considering his years, but his mind was gone and he
remembered no one.&nbsp; At the same time I saw a good deal of
Richard Lovett&mdash;a noble character&mdash;who worked all his
life for the mental and <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>moral
improvement of the working man, of whom he was such an
illustrious example.&nbsp; Cooper and Vincent and Lovett did much
between them to make the working man respected as he had never
been before.</p>
<p>One of the grandest old men I ever knew was George Cruikshank,
the artist, in his later years an ardent advocate of Temperance,
but a real Bohemian nevertheless, enjoying life and all its
blessings to the last.&nbsp; At a dinner-party or at a social
gathering of any kind he was at his best, full of anecdote,
overflowing with wit and mimicry; as an orator also he had great
power, and generally managed to keep his audience in a roar of
laughter.&nbsp; While perfectly sober himself, he was very happy
in taking off the drunkard&rsquo;s eccentricities, and would sing
&ldquo;We are not fou,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Willie brewed a peck
o&rsquo; malt,&rdquo; as if he deemed a toper the prince of good
fellows.&nbsp; In his old age he had persuaded himself that to
him Dickens owed many of his happiest inspirations, a remark
which the author of &ldquo;The Pickwick Papers&rdquo; strongly
resented.&nbsp; At his home I met on one occasion Mrs. Dickens, a
very pleasant, motherly lady, with whom one would have thought
any husband could have happily lived, although the great novelist
himself seemed to be of another way of thinking.&nbsp;
Cruikshank&rsquo;s wife seems to have been devoted to him.&nbsp;
She was proud of him, as well she might be.&nbsp; He had a good
<!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>head of hair, and to the last cherished a tremendous
lock which adorned his forehead.&nbsp; He was rather
square-built, with an eye that at one time must have rivalled
that of the far-famed hawk.&nbsp; He lived comfortably in a good
house just outside Mornington Crescent, in the Hampstead Road;
but he was never a wealthy man, and was always publishing little
pamphlets, which, whatever the fame they brought him, certainly
yielded little cash.&nbsp; He had seen a good deal of life, or
what a Cockney takes to be such, and when he was buried in Kensal
Green, the attendance at the funeral showed how large was the
circle of his friends and admirers.&nbsp; To the last he was
proud of his whiskers.</p>
<p>Another friend of mine buried in the same place was Dr.
Charles Mackay, the original editor of <i>The Illustrated London
News</i>, and who differed so much with the proprietor, Mr.
Ingram, M.P., on the character of the late French Emperor, for
whom Dr. Mackay had a profound contempt, that he had to resign,
and commenced <i>The London Review</i>, which did not last
long.&nbsp; At one time his songs, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good
time coming, boys,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cheer boys, cheer,&rdquo;
were played on every barrel-organ, and were to be heard in every
street.&nbsp; Another of the workers on <i>The Illustrated
News</i> was John Timbs, the unwearying publisher of popular
books of anecdotes, by which, I fear, he did not make <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>much money, as he had to end his days in the Charter
House.&nbsp; His department was to look after the engravings, a
duty which compelled him to sit up all night on Thursdays.&nbsp;
Before he had joined Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s staff, he had edited a
small periodical called <i>The Mirror</i>, devoted to useful and
amusing literature.&nbsp; I fancy his happiest hours were passed
chatting with the literary men who were always hovering round the
office of the paper&mdash;like Mr. Micawber, in the hope of
something turning up.&nbsp; You could not be long there without
seeing Mark Lemon&mdash;a mountain of a man connected with
<i>Punch</i>, who could act Falstaff without stuffing&mdash;who
was Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s private secretary.&nbsp; A wonderful
contrast to Mark Lemon was Douglas Jerrold, a little grey-haired,
keen-eyed man, who seemed to me to walk the streets hurriedly, as
if he expected a bailiff to touch him on the back.&nbsp; Later, I
knew his son, Mr. Blanchard Jerrold, very well, and always found
him a very courteous and pleasant gentleman.&nbsp; With Hain
Friswell, with the ever-sparkling, black-eyed George Augustus
Sala, with that life-long agitator Jesse Jacob Holyoake, for whom
I had a warm esteem, I was also on very friendly terms.&nbsp;
Once, and once only, I had an interview with Mr. Charles
Bradlaugh who, when he recognised me as &ldquo;Christopher
Crayon&rdquo; of <i>The Christian World</i>, gave me a hearty
shake of the hands.&nbsp; Had he <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>lived, I
believe he would have become a Christian.&nbsp; At any rate, of
later years, his hostility to Christianity seemed to have
considerably toned down.&nbsp; Be that as it may, I always held
him to be one of the most honest of our public men.&nbsp; I had
also the pleasure once of sitting next Mr. Labouchere at a dinner
at a friend&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He talked much, smoked more, and was
as witty as Waller, and like him on cold water.&nbsp; Another
teetotaler with whom I came much into contact was the late Sir
Benjamin Ward Richardson, a shortish, stout man to look at, a
good public speaker, and warmly devoted alike to literature and
science.&nbsp; Another distinguished man whom I knew well was Mr.
James Hinton, the celebrated aurist and a writer on religious
matters which at one time had great effect.&nbsp; He was the son
of the celebrated Baptist preacher, the Rev. John Howard Hinton,
and I was grieved to learn that he had given up his practice as
an aurist in Saville Row, and had bought an orange estate far
away in the Azores, where he went to die of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>On the whole I am inclined to think I never had a pleasanter
man to do with than Mr. Cobden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
commence a movement in favour of Free Trade in land?&rdquo; I one
day said to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;I
am too old for that.&nbsp; I have done my share of work.&nbsp; I
must leave that to be taken up by <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>younger
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, strange to say, though this has always
seemed to me the great want of the age, the work has been left
undone, and all the nation suffers in consequence.&nbsp; As an
illustration of Mr. Cobden&rsquo;s persuasiveness let me give the
following.&nbsp; Once upon a time he came to Norwich to address
an audience of farmers there&mdash;in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, I
think.&nbsp; On my asking an old Norfolk farmer what he thought
of Mr. Cobden as a speaker, his reply was, &ldquo;Why he got such
a hold of us that if he had held up a sheet of white paper on the
platform and said it was black, there was not a farmer in the
hall but would have said the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cobden never
irritated his opponents.&nbsp; He had a marvellous power of
talking them round.&nbsp; In this respect he was a wonderful
contrast to his friend and colleague, John Bright.</p>
<p>A leading teetotaler with whom I had much to do was the late
Mr. Smithies, founder of <i>The British Workman</i> and
publications of a similar class.&nbsp; At an enormous expense he
commenced his illustrated paper, full of the choicest engravings,
and published at a price so as to secure them a place in the
humblest home.&nbsp; For a long while it was published at a
loss.&nbsp; But Mr. Smithies bravely held on, as his aim, I
honestly believe, was to do good rather than make money.&nbsp; He
was a Christian social reformer, a Wesleyan, indifferent to
politics, as Wesleyans more or less were at one time.&nbsp; <!--
page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Square-built, of rather less than medium height, with a
ruddy face, and a voice that could be heard all over Exeter
Hall&mdash;he looked the picture of health and happiness.&nbsp; I
never saw him frown but when I approached him with a cigar in my
mouth.&nbsp; Mr. Smithies was one of the earliest to rally round
the Temperance banner.&nbsp; His whole life was devoted to doing
good in his own way.&nbsp; He never married, and lived with his
mother, a fine old lady, who contrived to give her dutiful and
affectionate son somewhat of an antiquated cast of thought, and
never was he happier than when in the company of Lady Burdett
Coutts or great Earl Shaftesbury.</p>
<p>I had also a good deal to do with Mr. W. H. Collingridge, who
founded that successful paper, <i>The City Press</i>, which his
genial son, Mr. G. Collingridge, still carries on.&nbsp; By means
of my connection with <i>The City Press</i> I came into contact
with many City leaders and Lord Mayors, and saw a good deal of
City life at the Mansion House and at grand halls of the City
Companies.&nbsp; I think the tendency in these days is much to
run down the City Corporation.&nbsp; People forget that the
splendid hospitality of the Mansion House helps to exalt the fame
and power of England all the world over.&nbsp; Once upon a time I
attended a Liberal public meeting at which two M.P.&rsquo;s had
spoken.&nbsp; One of the committee said to me, &ldquo;Now you
must <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>make a speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; My reply
was that there was no need to do so, as the M.P.&rsquo;s had said
all that was required.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said my
friend, &ldquo;not a word has been said about the Corporation of
London.&nbsp; Pitch into them!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have drunk too much of their punch and
swallowed too much of their turtle-soup.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will
never run down the City Fathers, many of whom I knew and
respected, and at whose banquets men gathered&mdash;not merely
City people, but the leading men of all the world.&nbsp; The
glory of the Mansion House is the glory of the land.</p>
<p>I could go on for a long while.&nbsp; Have I not been to
<i>soir&eacute;es</i> at great men&rsquo;s houses and met all
sorts and conditions of people?&nbsp; Only two men have I given
myself the trouble to be introduced to&mdash;one was Barnum,
because he frankly admitted he was a humbug, though he seemed a
decent fellow enough in private life.&nbsp; Another was Cetewayo,
the jolliest-looking Kaffir I ever saw, and I went to see him
because our treatment of him was a shame and a national
disgrace.&nbsp; Once on a time as we were waiting for Royalty on
a distant platform, one of the committee offered to introduce me
to H.R.H.&nbsp; I declined, on the plea that I must draw the line
somewhere, and that I drew it at princes, but oh! the vanity of
wasting one&rsquo;s time in society.&nbsp; Of the gay world,
perhaps the wittiest and pleasantest, as far as my personal
experience <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>is concerned, was the late Charles
Mathews.&nbsp; I had seen him on the stage and met him in his
brougham and talked with him, and once I was invited to a grand
party he gave to his friends and admirers.&nbsp; As I went into
the reception-room I wondered where the jaunty and juvenile actor
could be.&nbsp; All at once I saw a venerable, bald-headed old
man coming down on me.&nbsp; Oh! I said to myself, this must be
the butler coming to account for his master&rsquo;s
absence.&nbsp; Lo, and behold! it was Charley Mathews
himself!</p>

<span class="smcap">How I Put up for M.P.</span></h2>
<p>By this time people have got sick of electioneering.&nbsp; It
is a great privilege to be an English elector&mdash;to feel that
the eyes of the world are on you, and that, at any rate, your
country expects you to do your duty.&nbsp; But to the candidate
an election contest is, at any rate, fraught with
instruction.&nbsp; Human nature is undoubtedly a curious
combination, and a man who goes in for an election undoubtedly
sees a good deal of human nature.&nbsp; I was put up for a
Parliamentary borough&mdash;I who shudder at the sound of my own
voice, and who have come to regard speechmakers with as much
aversion as I should the gentleman in black.&nbsp; A borough was
for the first time to send a member to Parliament.&nbsp; It had
been hawked all over London in vain, and as a <i>dernier
ressort</i> the Liberal Association of the borough&mdash;a
self-elected clique of well-meaning nobodies&mdash;had determined
to run a highly respectable and well-connected gentleman whose
name and merits were alike unknown.&nbsp; Under such
circumstances I consented to fight the battle for freedom and
independence, as I hold that our <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>best men
should be sent to Parliament irrespective of property&mdash;that
candidates should not be forced on electors, and that unless our
Liberal Associations are really representative they may be worked
in a way injurious to the country and destructive of its
freedom.&nbsp; At my first meeting, like another C&aelig;sar, I
came, I saw, I conquered.&nbsp; The chiefs of the Liberal
Association had assembled to put me down.&nbsp; I was not put
down, and, amidst resounding cheers, I was declared the adopted
candidate.&nbsp; The room was crowded with friends.&nbsp; I never
shook so many dirty hands in my life.&nbsp; A second meeting,
equally successful, confirmed the first, and I at once plunged
into the strife.&nbsp; I am not here to write the history of an
election, but to tell of my personal experiences, which were
certainly amusing.&nbsp; The first result of my candidature led
to a visit from an impecunious Scot at my suburban residence, who
had read my programme with infinite delight.&nbsp; He came to
assure me of his best wishes for my success.&nbsp; He was,
unfortunately, not an elector, but he was a Scotchman, as he was
sure I was, and sadly in want of a loan, which he was certain,
from my Liberal sentiments, I would be the last to refuse to a
brother Scot.&nbsp; I had hardly got rid of him before I was
called upon by an agent of one of our great Radical
societies&mdash;a society with which I had something to do in its
younger days before it <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>had become
great and powerful, but which, like most people when they got up
in the world, forgot its humble friends.&nbsp; Ah, thought I, the
society is going to give me a little aid to show its appreciation
of my ancient service, and I felt pleased accordingly.&nbsp; Not
a bit of it.&nbsp; Mr. P. was the collector of the society, and
he came to see what he could get out of me, assuring me that
almost all the Liberal candidates had responded to his
appeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I am going to buy the sanction
of your society by a paltry fiver?&rdquo; was my reply; and the
agent went away faster than he came.&nbsp; My next visitor was a
pleasant, plausible representative of some workmen&rsquo;s
league, to assure me of his support, and then, with abundance of
promise, he went his way, leaving me to look for a performance of
which I saw no sign.&nbsp; Then came the ladies.&nbsp; Would I
give them an interview?&nbsp; Some of them wanted to set me right
on Temperance questions; others on topics on which no
right-minded woman should care to speak, and on which few would
speak were it not for the morbid, sensational, hysterical feeling
which often overcomes women who have no families of their own to
look after, no household duties to discharge, no home to adorn
and purify.&nbsp; As I had no town house, and did not care to
invite the ladies to the smoking-room of my club, I in every such
case felt bound to deny myself the pleasure <!-- page 232--><a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>of an
interview.&nbsp; But my correspondents came from every quarter of
the land.&nbsp; Some offered me their services; others favoured
me with their views on things in general.&nbsp; It was seldom I
took the trouble to reply to them.&nbsp; One gentleman, I fear,
will never forgive me.&nbsp; He was an orator; he sent me
testimonials on the subject from such leading organs of public
opinion as <i>The Eatanswill Gazette</i> or <i>The Little
Pedlington Observer</i>, of the most wonderful character.&nbsp;
Evidently as an orator he was above all Greek, above all Roman
fame, and he was quite willing to come and speak at my meetings,
which was very kind, as he assured me that no candidate for whom
he had spoken was ever defeated at the poll.&nbsp; I ought to
have retained his services, I ought to have sent him a cheque, or
my thanks.&nbsp; Doubtless he would have esteemed them,
especially the latter.&nbsp; Alas! I did nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>But oh! the wearisome canvassing, which seems to be the only
way to success.&nbsp; Meetings are of little avail, organisation
is equally futile, paid agency simply leads the candidate into a
Serbonian bog, where</p>
<blockquote><p>Whole armies oft have perished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is house-to-house visitation that is the true secret
now.&nbsp; As far as I carried it out I was successful, though I
did not invariably embrace the wife of the voter or kiss the
babies.&nbsp; The <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>worst of it is, it takes so much
time.&nbsp; Now and then your friend is supernaturally
wise.&nbsp; You must stop and hear all he has to say, or you make
him an enemy.&nbsp; Some people&mdash;and I think they were
right&mdash;seemed to think a candidate has no business to
canvass electors at all.&nbsp; One highly respectable voter
seemed really angry as he told me, with a severity worthy of a
judge about to sentence a poor wretch to hanging, it was quite
needless for me to call, that he was not going to disgrace his
Baptist principles.&nbsp; Passing a corner public one Saturday I
was met with a friendly recognition.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
going to oblige you, Sir,&rdquo; said the spokesman of the party,
in a tone indicating that either he had not taken the Temperance
pledge, or that he was somewhat lax in his observance of it,
&ldquo;and now you must oblige us will you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Him I
left a sadder and a wiser man, as I had to explain that the
trifling little favour he sought at my hands might invalidate my
election.&nbsp; One female in a Peabody Building was hurt because
I had in my haste given a postman&rsquo;s rap at the door,
instead of one more in use in genteel society.&nbsp; In many a
model lodging-house I found a jolly widow, who, in answer to my
appeal if there were any gentlemen, seemed to intimate that the
male sex were held in no particular favour.&nbsp; The
Conservative female was, as a rule, rather hard and sarcastic,
and I was glad to beat <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>a retreat,
as she gave me to understand that she was not to be deceived by
anything I might say, and that she should take care how her
husband voted.&nbsp; Now and then I was favoured with a
dissertation on the evil of party, but I could always cut that
short by the remark, &ldquo;Oh, I see you are going to vote for
the Conservative candidate!&rdquo;&mdash;a remark which led to a
confession that in reality such was the case.&nbsp; The newly
enfranchised seemed proud of their privilege.&nbsp; It was not
from them I got the reply which I often heard where I should have
least expected it, &ldquo;Oh, I never interfere in
politics.&rdquo;&nbsp; People who had fads were a great
bore.&nbsp; One man would not vote for me because I was not sound
on the Sunday question; others who were of the same political
opinions as myself would not support me because I laughed at
their pet theories.&nbsp; But the great drawback was that I had
come forward without leave from the party chiefs, and hence their
toadies, lay or clerical, sternly held aloof.&nbsp; Barely was I
treated uncourteously, except when my declaration that I was a
Radical led to an intimation on the part of the voter that the
sooner I cleared out the better.</p>
<p>I would suggest that all canvassing be prohibited&mdash;you
want to get at the public opinion of the borough, and that you do
not obtain when you extort a promise from a voter who has no
definite opinion himself.&nbsp; <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Public
meetings and an advertisement or circular should be sufficient;
but there are many voters who will not take the trouble to
attend, and a public meeting, even if enthusiastic, is no
criterion of what the vote will be.&nbsp; It is easy to get up a
public meeting if a candidate will go to the necessary expense;
and it is easier still to spoil one if the opposition committee
can secure the services of a few roughs or an Irishman or
two.&nbsp; Democratic Socialists I also found very efficient in
that way, unable as they would have been to carry a candidate, or
to hold a public meeting themselves.&nbsp; One of the funniest
performances was, after you had had your say, to reply to the
questions.&nbsp; As a rule, the questioner thinks chiefly of
himself.&nbsp; He likes the sound of his voice, and he sits down
with a self-satisfied smile&mdash;if he be an old hand&mdash;as
if he had made it self-evident that he knew a thing or two, and
that he was not the sort of man you could make a fool of.&nbsp;
But heckling, as it is called, is a science little
understood.&nbsp; It is one of the fine arts.&nbsp; A candidate,
for instance, likes to make a statement when he replies to a
question.&nbsp; The questioner, if he is up to the mark, will
gain a cheer, as he denounces all attempts at evasion, and
demands a straightforward, Yes or No.&nbsp; A man asks you, for
instance, Have you left off beating your wife yet?&nbsp; How are
you to answer Yes or <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>No in such a case?&nbsp; As a rule,
the questioners are poor performers, and ask you what no one need
ask who hears a candidate&rsquo;s speech, or reads his
programme.&nbsp; One thing came out very clearly&mdash;that is,
the terror platform orators, lay or clerical, have of any body
calling itself a Liberal Association, whether it is really that
or not.&nbsp; You can get any number of orators, on the condition
that you have an association at your back.&nbsp; But they dare
not otherwise lend you a helping hand.&nbsp; Liberalism is to
have the stamp of Walbrook on it.&nbsp; It must be such as the
wirepullers approve.&nbsp; I said to a Radical M.P.: &ldquo;I am
fighting a sham caucus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they all
shams?&rdquo; was his reply.&nbsp; There is a danger in this;
even though there are still men left in this age of mechanical
organism who value the triumph of principles more even than that
of party.</p>
<p>My experience is anybody can get into Parliament if he will
keep pegging away and has plenty of money.&nbsp; Let him keep
himself before the public&mdash;by writing letters to the
newspapers, and by putting in an appearance at all public
meetings, and by promising wholesale as to what he will do.&nbsp;
If he can bray like a bull, and has a face of brass, and has
money or friends who have it, he may be sure of success.&nbsp; As
a rule, the best way is to get yourself known to the public in
connection with some new development of philanthropic life.&nbsp;
But a little <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>money is a great help.&nbsp; Gold
touches hearts as nothing else can.&nbsp; The biggest Radical of
two candidates naturally prefers the richer.&nbsp; Men who can
crowd into all meetings, and shout &ldquo;Buggins for
ever,&rdquo; are useful allies, and men of that stamp have little
sympathy with the poor candidates.&nbsp; Once in Parliament you
are useless, at the beck and call of the whipper-in, a slave to
party; but you are an M.P. nevertheless, and may not call your
soul your own.</p>

<span class="smcap">How I Was Made a Fool Of</span>.</h2>
<p>At length I am in the home of the free, where all men are
equal, where O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa may seek to blast the glories
of a thousand years, where a Henry George may pave the way for an
anarchy such as the world has never yet seen, where even Jem
Blaine, as his admirers term him, passes for an honest man, and
claims to have a firm grip on the Presidential chair.</p>
<p>I am unfortunate on my landing.&nbsp; I have the name of one
of Cook&rsquo;s hotels on my lips, and as I know Mr. John Cook
makes better terms for his customers than they can do for
themselves, I resolve to go there, but every one tells me there
is no such hotel as that I ask for in New York, and I am taken to
one which is recommended by a respectable-looking
policeman.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is the head-quarters of the
veteran corps of the Army of the Potomac, who swarm all over the
place, as they did all over the South in the grand times of
old.&nbsp; I am not fond of heroes; heroes are the men who have
kept out of danger, while their less fortunate comrades have been
mowed down, and who appropriate the honours which belong often to
<!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>the departed alone.&nbsp; Well, these heroes are
holding the fort so tightly that I resolve to leave my quarters
and explore the Broadway, one of the most picturesque promenades
in the world.&nbsp; Suddenly I meet a stranger, who asks me how I
am.&nbsp; I reply he has the advantage of me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you were at our store last
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; I reply that was impossible.&nbsp; He tells
me his name is Bodger, I tell him my name, which, however, he
does not catch, whereupon he shakes my hand again, says how happy
he is to have met me, and we part to meet no more.&nbsp; I go a
few steps farther, and go through the same process with another
individual.&nbsp; I bear his congratulations with fortitude, but
when, a few minutes after, the same thing occurs again, I begin
to wish I were in Hanover rather than in New York, and I resolve
to seek out Cook&rsquo;s Agency without further delay.&nbsp; Of
course I was directed wrong, and that led to a disaster which
will necessarily shorten my visit to Uncle Sam.&nbsp; Perhaps I
ought not to tell my experience.&nbsp; People generally are
silent when they have to tell anything to their own
discredit.&nbsp; If I violate that rule, it will be to put people
on their guard.&nbsp; If I am wrong in doing so, I hope the rigid
moralist will skip this altogether.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a young man came rushing up to me, with a face
beaming with joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good morning, Mr.&mdash;,&rdquo;
he exclaimed; &ldquo;I am so glad we have met.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
intimated that I did not <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>recollect
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we came over in the
<i>Sarnia</i> together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, the story was not
improbable.&nbsp; Of the 1,000 on board the <i>Sarnia</i> I could
not be expected to remember all.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is
G.,&rdquo; mentioning a well-known banker in London, and then he
began to tell me of his travels, at what hotel he was staying,
and finally added that he had been presented with a couple of
Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i>, handsomely bound, as a prize,
and that he would be glad if I would accept one.&nbsp; Well, as
my copy of Longfellow was rather the worse for wear, I told him I
would accept it with pleasure.&nbsp; But I must come with him for
it.&nbsp; I did so, and while doing so learned from him that the
prize had been given in connection with a lottery scheme for
raising money to build a church down South.&nbsp; The idea seemed
to me odd, but Brother Jonathan&rsquo;s ways are not as ours, and
I was rather pleased to find that I had thus a new chance of
seeing religious life, and of having something fresh to write
about.&nbsp; I am free to confess, as the great Brougham was wont
to say, I jumped at the offer.&nbsp; In a few minutes we were
inside a respectable-looking house, where a tall gentleman
invited us to be seated, regretting that the copies of Longfellow
had not come home from the binder&rsquo;s, and promising that we
should have them by noon.&nbsp; Next he unfolded what I thought
was a plan of the proposed church, <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>but which
proved to be a chart with figures&mdash;with prizes, as it seemed
to me, to all the figures.&nbsp; To my horror my friend took up
the cards, and asked me to select them for him.&nbsp; This I did,
and he won a thousand dollars, blessing me as he shook hands with
me warmly, and saying that as I had won half I must have
half.&nbsp; Well, as the ticket had certain conditions, and as I
felt that it was rather hard on the church to take all that
money, I continued the game for a few minutes, my young friend
being eager that I should do so, till the truth dawned upon me
that I had been drawn into a swindlers&rsquo; den, and that I and
my friend were dupes, and I resolved to leave off playing, much
to the regret of my friend, who gave the keeper of the table a
cheque for &pound;100, which he would pay for me, as I would not,
and thus by another effort retrieve my loss.&nbsp; There was one
spot only on the board marked blank, and that, of course, was
his.&nbsp; Burning with indignation I got up to go, my friend
following me, saying how much he regretted that he had led me
into such a place, offering to pay me half my losses when he
returned to town, and begging me not to say a word about the
subject when I got back to London, as it might get him into a
row.&nbsp; I must say, so great has been my experience of honour
among men, and never having been in New York before, I believed
in that young man till <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>we parted,
as I did not see how he could have gained all the knowledge he
displayed of myself and movements unless he had travelled with me
as he said, and had never heard of Bunkum men.&nbsp; I had not
gone far, however, before I was again shaken by the hand by a
gentlemanly young fellow, who claimed to have met me at Montreal,
where he had been introduced to me as the son of Sir H&mdash;
A&mdash;.&nbsp; He had been equally lucky&mdash;had got two
books, and, as he was going back to Quebec that very afternoon,
would give me one of them if I would ride with him as far as his
lodgings.&nbsp; Innocently I told him my little tale.&nbsp; He
advised me to say nothing about it, as I had been breaking the
law and might get myself into trouble, and then suddenly
recollecting he must get his ticket registered, and saying that
he would overtake me directly, left me to go as far as the place
of our appointed rendezvous alone.&nbsp; Then the truth flashed
on me that both my pretended friends were rogues, and that I had
been the victim of what, in New York, they call the Bunkum men,
who got 300 dollars out of Oscar Wilde, and a good deal more out
of Mr. Adams, formerly American Ambassador in England.&nbsp; I
had never heard of them, I own, and both the rogues had evidently
got so much of my history by heart that I might well fancy that
they were what they described themselves to be.&nbsp; As to
finding <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>them out to make them regorge that
was out of the question.&nbsp; Landlords and policemen seemed to
take it quite as a matter of course that the stranger in New York
is thus to be done.&nbsp; Since then I have hardly spoken to a
Yankee, nor has a Yankee spoken to me.&nbsp; I now understand why
the Yankees are so reserved, and never seem to speak to each
other.&nbsp; They know each other too well.&nbsp; I now
understand also how the men you meet look so thin and careworn,
and can&rsquo;t sleep at nights.&nbsp; We are not all saints in
London.&nbsp; Chicago boasts that it is the wickedest city in the
world, but I question whether New York may not advance a stronger
claim to the title.&nbsp; Yet what an Imperial city is New
York!&nbsp; How endless is its restless life! and how it runs
over with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and worldly
pride!&nbsp; As I wandered to the spot in Wall Street (where, by
the bye, the stockbrokers and their clerks are not in appearance
to be compared to our own) I felt, sad as I was, a thrill of
pleasure run through me, as there Washington took the oath as the
first President of the young and then pure Republic; and then, as
the evening came on, I strolled up and down in the park-like
squares by means of which New York looks like a fairy world by
night, with the people sitting under the shade of the trees,
resting after the labours of the day; while afar the gay <!--
page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>crowds are dining or supping at Delmonico&rsquo;s, or
wandering in and out of the great hotels which rear their heads
like palaces&mdash;as I looked at all that show and splendour
(and in London we have nothing to compare with it), one seemed to
forget how evanescent was that splendour, how unreal that
show!&nbsp; I was reminded of it, however, as I retired to rest,
by the announcement that in one part of my hotel was the way to
the fire-escape, and by the notice in my bedroom that the
proprietor would not be responsible for my boots if I put them
outside the door to be blackened.&nbsp; In New York there seems
to be no confidence in anybody or anything.</p>
<p>As I told my story to a sweet young American lady she said,
&ldquo;Ah, you must have felt very mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
a bit of it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the meanness seemed to be all
on the other side.&rdquo;&nbsp; Americans talk English, so they
tell me, better than we do ourselves!&nbsp; Since then I have
seen the same game played elsewhere.&nbsp; In Australia I have
heard of many a poor emigrant robbed in this way.&nbsp; A
plausible looking gentleman tried it on with me at Melbourne when
I was tramping up and down Burke Street one frying
afternoon.&nbsp; He had come with me, he said, by the steamer
from Sydney to Melbourne.&nbsp; I really thought I had met him at
Brisbane.&nbsp; At any rate, his wife was ill, and he was going
back with her to London by the very steamer <!-- page 248--><a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>that I was
travelling by to Adelaide.&nbsp; Would I come with him as far as
the Club?&nbsp; Of course I said yes.&nbsp; The Melbourne Club is
rather a first-class affair.&nbsp; But somehow or other we did
not get as far as the Club.&nbsp; My friend wanted to call on a
friend in a public-house on the way.&nbsp; Would I have a
drink?&nbsp; No, I was much obliged, but I did not want a
drink.&nbsp; I sat down smoking, and he came and sat beside
me.&nbsp; Presently a decent-looking man came up to my new friend
with a bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wait till
to-morrow?&rdquo; asked my friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I am rather
pressed for money,&rdquo; said the man, respectfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, then, here it is,&rdquo; said my friend, pulling a
heap of gold, or what looked like it, out of his pocket.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; said he, turning to me, &ldquo;I am a
sovereign short; can you lend me one?&rdquo;&nbsp; No, I could
not.&nbsp; Could I lend him half-a-sovereign?&nbsp; No; I could
not.&nbsp; Could I lend him five shillings?&nbsp; I had not even
that insignificant sum to spare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it does not
matter,&rdquo; said my friend; &ldquo;I can get the money over
the way, I will just go and fetch it, and will be back in five
minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he and his confederate went away
together to be seen no more by me.&nbsp; Certainly he was not on
board the <i>Austral</i>, as I took my passage in her to
Adelaide.</p>
<p>As I left I met a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any rogues in these parts?&rdquo; I innocently
asked.</p>
<p><!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>&ldquo;Well, we have a few.&nbsp; There was one from
New York a little while ago, but he had to go back home.&nbsp; He
said he was no match for our Melbourne rogues at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was well that I escaped scot-free.&nbsp; On
the steamer in which I returned there was a poor third-class
passenger who had lost his all in such a way.&nbsp; He was fool
enough to let the man treat him to a drink, and that little drink
proved rather a costly affair.&nbsp; All his hard-earned savings
had disappeared.</p>

<span class="smcap">Interviewing the President</span>.</h2>
<p>It is about time, I wrote one day in America, I set my face
homeward.&nbsp; When on the prairie I was beginning to speculate
whether I should ever be fit to make an appearance in descent
society again.&nbsp; Now, it seems to me, the question to be
asked is, Whether I have not soared so high in the world as to
have lost all taste for the frugal simplicity of that home life,
where, in the touching words of an American poet I met with this
morning, it is to be trusted my</p>
<blockquote><p>Daughters are acting day by day,<br />
So as not to bring disgrace on their papa far away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in Washington, I am made to pass for an
&ldquo;Honourable,&rdquo; in spite of my modest declarations to
the contrary, and have had the honour of a private interview with
the greatest man in this part of the world&mdash;the President of
the United States.&nbsp; One night, when I retired to rest, I
found my bedroom on the upper storey&mdash;contiguous to the
fire-escape, a convenience you <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>are always
bound to remember in the U.S.&mdash;had been changed for a
magnificent bedroom, with a gorgeous sitting-room attached, on
the first floor, and there loomed before me a terrific vision of
an hotel bill which I supposed I should have to pay: but then,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the odds so long as you are
happy?&rdquo;&nbsp; The question is, How came the change to be
made?&nbsp; Well, the fact is, I had a letter to a distinguished
politician, the Hon. Senator B&mdash;, and he, in his turn, sent
me a packet addressed to the Hon. J. E&mdash; R&mdash;; and all
at once I became a great man myself in the hotel.&nbsp; In a note
Mr. B&mdash; sent to the President he informed him that I had
been for thirty years a correspondent of certain papers; and in
another note to officials he has the goodness to speak of me as
&ldquo;the Hon. Mr. R&mdash;, a distinguished citizen and
journalist of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly, then, I have as
good a right to the best accommodation the hotel affords as any
other man, and accordingly I do take my ease in my inn, and not
dream, but do dwell, in marble halls, while obsequious blackies
fan me as I eat my meals, which consist of all the dainties
possible&mdash;the only things a fellow can eat this hot
weather.&nbsp; I am glad I have put up at Ebbet House,
Washington, where I am in clover.&nbsp; Like Bottom, I feel
myself &ldquo;translated.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Baltimore, the only
night I was there, I did not get a minute&rsquo;s sleep till
daylight, because the <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>National Convention of Master
Plumbers was holding its annual orgy just beneath, and I
seriously believed the place would be burned down before the
morning.&nbsp; In the dignified repose of Ebbet House I have no
such fear; my only anxiety is as to how I can ever again
reconcile myself to the time-honoured cold mutton of domestic
life after all this luxurious living.&nbsp; What made Senator
B&mdash; confer the dignity of Hon. on me I am at a loss to
understand.&nbsp; I know there are times when I think it right
and proper to blow my own trumpet in the unavoidable absence of
my trumpeter; but, in the present instance, I must candidly
confess to have done nothing of the kind.&nbsp; It is to be
presumed that my improved position, as regards lodging in Ebbet
House, Washington, is to be attributed to the social status given
me by Senator B&mdash;, a gentleman who, in personal appearance
and size, bears somewhat of a resemblance to our late lamented
Right Hon. W. E. Forster, with the exception that Mr. B&mdash;
brushes his hair&mdash;a process which evidently our Bradford
M.P. disdained.</p>
<p>This morning I have shaken hands with the President at the
White House&mdash;a modest building not larger than our Mansion
House, and, like that, interesting for its many
associations.&nbsp; Mr. Arthur is in the prime of life&mdash;a
tall, well-made man, with dark-brown hair and <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>eyes, of
rather sluggish temperament, apparently.&nbsp; He did not say
much to me, nor, I imagine, does he say much to anybody.&nbsp;
His plan seems to be to hear and see as much, and say as little
as he can.&nbsp; We met in a room upstairs, where, from ten to
eleven, he is at home to Congress men, who would see him on
public affairs before Congress meets, as eleven in the morning is
the usual hour when it commences business.&nbsp; There were seven
or eight waiting to speak to the President as he stood up at his
table, so as to get the light on his visitors&rsquo; faces, while
his own was shaded as much as possible; and, owing to the heat in
Washington, the houses are kept so shaded that, coming out of the
clear sunlight, it is not always easy at the first glance to see
where you are.&nbsp; The President did not seem particularly
happy to see anybody, and looked rather bored as the Senators and
Congress men buttonholed him.&nbsp; Of course, our conversation
was strictly private and confidential, and wild horses shall
never tear the secret from me.&nbsp; Posterity must remain in the
dark.&nbsp; It is one of those questions never to be revealed, as
much so as that which so provoked the ancients as to the song the
syrens sang to Ulysses.&nbsp; The President&rsquo;s enemies call
him the New York dude, because he happens to be a
gentlemanly-looking man, and patronises Episcopalianism, which in
America, as in England, <!-- page 257--><a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>is reckoned
&ldquo;the genteel thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Americans are hard to
please.&nbsp; Mr. James Russell Lowell had got the gout, and the
New York writers said, when I was there, he had attained the
object of a snob&rsquo;s ambition.&nbsp; It is thus they talked
of one of their country&rsquo;s brightest ornaments.&nbsp; But to
return to the President.&nbsp; He is a wise man, and keeps his
ears open and his mouth shut&mdash;a plan which might be adopted
by other statesmen with manifest advantage to themselves and the
community.&nbsp; The President wore a morning black coat, with a
rose in his buttonhole, and had the air about him of a man
accustomed to say to one, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and he comes; to
another, &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; and he goes.&nbsp; I made some few
remarks about Canada and America, to which he politely listened,
and then we shook hands and parted, he to be seized on by eager
Congress men, I to inspect the public apartments of the White
House.&nbsp; He has rather a hard life of it, I fancy, as he has
to work all day, and his only relaxation seems to be a ride in
the evening, as there are no private grounds connected with the
House.&nbsp; In the model Republic privacy is unknown.&nbsp;
Everything is open and aboveboard.&nbsp; Intelligent citizens
gain much thereby.</p>
<p>As to interviewing Royalty, that is another affair.&nbsp; An
American interviews his President as a right.&nbsp; In the Old
World monarchs keep people at arm&rsquo;s-length.&nbsp; And they
are right.&nbsp; <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>No man is a hero to his valet.&nbsp;
But I have interviewed the President of the United States; that
is something to think of.&nbsp; The interview was a
farce&mdash;but such is life.</p>

<span class="smcap">A Bank Gone</span>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Was there much of a sensation there when you left
B&mdash; this morning?&rdquo; said the manager of a leading daily
to me as I was comfortably seated in his pleasant room in the
fine group of buildings known to all the world as the printing
and publishing offices of <i>The West Anglian Daily</i>, where I
had gone in search of a little cash, which, happily, I
obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; said I, in utter ignorance of what
he was driving at.&nbsp; &ldquo;None at all; no one knew I was
leaving,&rdquo; and I smiled as if I had said something good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not mean that,&rdquo; said the manager.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It seems you have not heard the news.&nbsp; Brown and Co.
have suspended payment.&nbsp; We have just had a telegram to that
effect,&rdquo; which he handed me to read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
bank there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I never read the name of the firm; I only know that I
pay a small sum in monthly, and write a few cheques as occasion
requires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty fellow,&rdquo; said the
manager.</p>
<p><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>&ldquo;Now I come to think of it,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that must be my bank, as there is no other in the place,
except a small branch which has just been opened within the last
few months by Burney and Co.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sorry for you,&rdquo; said my friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it don&rsquo;t matter much to me,&rdquo; I replied,
with a vain attempt at a smile.&nbsp; Yet I was terribly annoyed,
nevertheless.&nbsp; I had let my deposit increase more than was
my general habit, thinking as Christmas was coming I would
postpone settling little accounts till after the festivities of
the Christmas season were over.&nbsp; I was now lamenting I had
done anything of the kind.&nbsp; I was not very happy.&nbsp; Our
little town of B&mdash; is a rising place, where people come and
spend a lot of money in the summer.&nbsp; Some spirited
individual or other is always putting up new buildings.&nbsp;
Speculation is rife, and the tradesmen hope to grow prosperous as
the place prospers.&nbsp; Anybody with half-a-crown in his pocket
to spare is hardly ever seen.&nbsp; They all bank at
Brown&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I daresay such of them as are able
overdraw.&nbsp; Private bankers who are anxious to do business
offer great facilities in this respect; but still there are many,
chiefly poor widows and sailors who make a little money in the
summer, and they bank it all.&nbsp; We have a church that is
about to be enlarged, and the money that has been raised for the
purpose was placed <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>in the bank, and we have a few
retired officers and tradesmen who have their money there.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They ha&rsquo; got &pound;300 of my money,&rdquo; said an
angry farmer, as he banged away at the closed door, on which a
notice was suspended that, in consequence of temporary
difficulties, the bank had stopped payment for a few days.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You might ha&rsquo; given a fellow the hint to take out
his money,&rdquo; said another irritated individual to the
manager, whom persistent knocking had brought to the door.&nbsp;
I was sorry for the manager; he always wore a smile on his
face.&nbsp; That smile had vanished as the last rose of
summer.&nbsp; No one in B&mdash; was more upset than he was when
the catastrophe occurred.&nbsp; Some of the knowing ones in town
had smelt a rat; one or two depositors had drawn out very
heavily.&nbsp; Our smiling manager had no conception of what was
to happen till, just as he was sitting down to his breakfast,
with his smiling wife and ruddy, fat-cheeked little ones, there
came to him a telegram from headquarters to the effect that he
was not to open, followed by a messenger with despatches of which
he was as ignorant as the merest ploughboy.&nbsp; I must say that
in the headquarters the secret was well kept, whatever the
leakage elsewhere.</p>
<p>Coming back to B&mdash;, the bright little town seemed sitting
in the shadow of death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; said I to
the station-master as I got <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>out of the
train.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only that the bank is broke,&rdquo; was the
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! that won&rsquo;t matter to you,&rdquo;
said one to me, &ldquo;your friends will help you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In vain I repeated that I had no friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
well,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;you can work; it is the old,
the infirm, the sick, who are past work, for whom I am
sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus I am left to sleep off my losses as
best I may, trying to believe that the difficulty is only
temporary, and positively assured in some quarters that the bank
will open all right next day.&nbsp; Alas! hope tells a flattering
tale.&nbsp; Next morning, after a decent interval, to show that,
like Dogberry, I am used to losses, I take my morning walk and
casually pass the bank, only to see that the door is as firmly
closed as ever; I read all the morning papers, and they tell me
that the bank will be opened as usual at ten.&nbsp; I know
better, and all I meet are sorrowing.&nbsp; One melancholy
depositor, who tells me that the bank has all the money he has
taken this summer and his pension besides, assures me that the
bank will open at twelve.&nbsp; I pass two hours later, and it is
still shut.&nbsp; Women are weeping as they see ruin staring them
in the face.&nbsp; Woe to me; my butcher calls for his little
account.&nbsp; I have to ask him to call again.&nbsp; I see the
tax-gatherer eyeing me from afar, likewise the shoemaker; but I
rush inside to find that the midday mail has arrived, bringing me
a letter from town, as <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>follows:
&ldquo;With respect to your cheque on Brown&rsquo;s Bank,
received yesterday, I regret to hear this day of the suspension
of the bank.&nbsp; Under these circumstances your cheque will not
be cleared, so that we shall have to debit your account with
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is pleasant.&nbsp; I have another cheque
sent by the same post as the other.&nbsp; I begin to fear on that
account.&nbsp; Happily, no more letters of that kind come in, and
I take another turn in the open air.&nbsp; Every one looks
grave.&nbsp; There are little knots of men standing like
conspirators in every street.&nbsp; They are trying to comfort
one another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it will be all right,&rdquo; I hear
them exclaim; but they look as if they did not believe what they
said, and felt it was all wrong.&nbsp; Now and then one steals
away towards the bank, but the door is still shut, and he comes
back gloomier-looking than ever.&nbsp; I am growing sad
myself.&nbsp; I have not seen a smile or heard a pleasant word
to-day, except from my neighbour, who chuckles over the fact that
his account is overdrawn.&nbsp; He laughs on the other side of
his mouth, however, when he realises the fact that he has cheques
he has not sent in.&nbsp; Another day comes, and I know my
fate.&nbsp; Some banks have agreed to come to the rescue.&nbsp;
They will pay all bank-notes in full, and will make advances not
exceeding 15s. in the pound in respect of credit accounts as may
be necessary.&nbsp; Happily, our little town is safe.&nbsp; <!--
page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>Another day or two of this strain on our credit must
have thrown us all into a general smash.&nbsp; This is good as
far as it goes, but I fail to see why the holder of one of
Brown&rsquo;s banknotes is to have his money in full, while I am
to accept a reduction of five shillings in the pound or
more.&nbsp; However, I have no alternative.&nbsp; I would not
mind the reduction if my friends the creditors would accept a
similar reduction in their little accounts.&nbsp; Alas! it is no
use making such a proposal to them; I must grin and bear
it.&nbsp; One consolation is that my wife&mdash;bless
her!&mdash;is away holiday-making and does not need to ask me for
cash.&nbsp; On the third day we begin to fear that we may not get
ten shillings in the pound, and the post brings me back another
cheque with a modest request for cash by return.&nbsp; All over
the country there is weeping and wailing.&nbsp; One would bear it
better a month hence.&nbsp; Christmas is coming!&nbsp; Already
the bells are preparing to ring it in.&nbsp; I must put on the
conventional smile.&nbsp; Christmas cards are coming in, wishing
me a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! and, oh dear! I must
say, Thank you!&nbsp; Alas! alas! troubles are like
babies&mdash;the more you nurse them, the bigger they grow.</p>
<p>And now it is time for me to make my bow and retire.&nbsp;
Having said that my bank was smashed up, I cannot expect any one
to be subsequently interested in my proceedings.&nbsp; We live in
a commercial country and a commercial <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>age, and
the men whom the society journals reverence are the men who have
made large fortunes, either by their own industry and forethought
and self-denial, or by the devil&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; And I am
inclined to think that he has a good deal to do with the
matter.&nbsp; If ever we are to have plain living and high
thinking, we shall have to give up this wonderful worship of
worldly wealth and show.&nbsp; Douglas Jerrold makes one of his
heroes exclaim, &ldquo;Every man has within him a bit of a
swindler.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Madame Roland died on the scaffold,
whither she had been led by the so-called champions of liberty
and equality and the rights of man, she exclaimed, as every
school-boy knows, or ought to know, &ldquo;Oh, Liberty, what
crimes are done in thy name!&rdquo;&nbsp; So say I, Oh, wealth,
which means peace and happiness, and health and joy (Sydney Smith
used to say that he felt happier for every extra guinea he had in
his pocket, and most of us can testify the same), what crimes are
done in thy name; not alone in the starvation of the poor, in the
underpaying of the wage-earning class who help to make it, but in
the way in which sharks and company promoters seek to defraud the
few who have saved money of all their store.&nbsp; You recollect
Douglas Jerrold makes the hero already referred to say,
&ldquo;You recollect Glass, the retired merchant?&nbsp; What an
excellent man was Glass!&nbsp; A pattern man to make a whole
generation by.&nbsp; <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>What could surpass him in what is
called honesty, rectitude, moral propriety, and other
gibberish?&nbsp; Well, Glass grows a beard.&nbsp; He becomes one
of a community, and immediately the latent feeling (swindling)
asserts itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the worst of it is that Glass as
a company director and promoter is worshipped as a great man,
especially if he secures a gratuitous advertisement by liberality
in religious and philanthropic circles, and exercises a lavish
liberality in the way of balls and dinners.&nbsp; Society crawls
at his feet as they used to do when poor Hudson, the ex-draper of
York, reigned a few years in splendour as the Railway King.&nbsp;
Glass goes everywhere, gets into Parliament.&nbsp; Rather
dishonest, a sham and a fraud as he is, we make him an idol, and
then scorn far-away savages who make idols of sticks and
stones.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
